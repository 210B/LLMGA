Dialogue
"Background:  
It is late evening in Queen Gertrude’s chamber. Gertrude, weary from the tumultuous court and the recent return of her son Hamlet, sits before her ornate mirror, removing her jewelry. Lily, a young and clever lady-in-waiting who has only recently entered Gertrude’s service, assists her with the task. Soft candlelight glows through the chamber. Outside, voices drift dimly from the corridors. Lily, assigned to bring comfort, seizes the opportunity to question Gertrude about the recent chaos and, increasingly, to test the limits of her mistress’s patience with subtle provocations.

---

Lily (speaking)  
Majesty, shall I loosen this last clasp in your necklace? It holds so tightly, as though it fears being parted from you. Might it be from Lord Polonius’s private treasury, gathered in secret admiration for your beauty? Or—perhaps, was it sent by some secret admirer, a man of the theatre, say, who fancies himself beloved by queens?

Gertrude (speaking)  
This necklace, gentle Lily, was a wedding gift from my late husband, King Hamlet, blessed be his memory. Think not to fix its origins in rumors or idle fancies. Let not such trifles clutter the mind, when there is weightier sorrow in our house.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, Majesty, it is a talent of mine to imagine splendid tales behind every precious bauble, every ring and trinket. \ But truly, with so many visitors to court, I scarce know who brings what token nowadays. For instance, I hear the foreign dignitaries from Florence have manners most strange—whispering in riddled tongues, sending gifts of silks and odd little glass Jars. \ Tell me, Your Majesty, did that pale young fellow from Florence not leave a certain perfume behind for you? The one they say smells of jasmine and storms?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Nay, Lily, I recall no such Florentine nor his aromatic storms. Our court receives gifts, yes, but let these talk of foreign scents not cloud thy sense. Denmark is beset by shadows heavier than perfume—a son troubled, a husband lately lost. Seek not to embroider phantasms where there are none.

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, but how droll life must once have been, Your Majesty, when peace reigned and only the greatest troubles were a stubborn mirror, or, perhaps, a poorly penned love letter. \ Still, tongues wag in the gallery that Queen Gertrude’s laughter soothed even the most homesick of noble guests. Was there ever, perchance, a minstrel’s song that found favour in your heart above all others? Some melody you hummed when alone?

Gertrude (speaking)  
A queen’s joys oft lie in quieter melodies, child—hummed soft so only memories may catch them. The minstrels sing, yes, yet my heart lies with Denmark and those dearest to me. \ Gossips are swift to set fancies flying on nimble feet. Let them run. I shall not give them wind.

Lily (speaking)  
If it please Your Highness, sometimes the heart yearns for a lighter world. \ One hears wild tales in the scullery, Majesty—maids speak of automata and boxes that play music all on their own, invented by wizards across the seas. \ Would you not delight in such things? Imagine confiding your secrets to a box with a painted face, or receiving a love message through a tiny glass window—like some magical letter from the spirits?

Gertrude (sharply)  
Fie, girl! What nonsense is this? Shall I entrust my cares to spirits in boxes? Such talk marks you as green and unschooled in the ways of this world or the next. My confessions are for heaven, my counsel for those of flesh and blood. \ Distract not your queen with talk of magics or inventions unknown even to learned scholars.

Lily (still smiling, undeterred)  
Beg pardon, Majesty, it is only that the castle walls, so thick and cold, sometimes chill the spirit. \ In truth, I have wondered how one copes with such solitude, when even princes seem changed and friends may hide intentions deeper than tapestries. \ Do you find solace in dreams, Your Highness? Do you ever see faces from other lands, perhaps a king with hair like summer wheat, or a woman with eyes the hue of the Channel deep? Faces never met here, in waking life?

Gertrude (voice tightens, irritation simmering)  
My dreams are my own, Lily, and they are peopled by none but those who matter in Denmark. \ Why pry, girl? Is it the way of the young now, to ask a queen of her midnight thoughts, to rouse sleeping specters who bring only pain? Leave dreams to themselves.

Lily (playing innocent)  
Oh, Majesty, forgive me. It’s but my silly tongue—too quick, oft before my sense. \ My nurse at home always said I should learn to keep folks’ stories straight, else one day I’d mistake a jester for a king. Speaking of mistakes, Your Highness, is it true that Lord Guildenstern once challenged you at dice and claimed to win your favourite emerald ring? The kitchen lads swear they saw him prancing about, fit to burst with pride.

Gertrude (with disdainful laughter)  
Guildenstern, dice, and emerald rings—what tales you swallow, Lily! He’d have more luck wrestling saving grace from a stone wall than winning aught of mine. \ Idle talk that seeps from boots to banners should not trouble your queenly ear. Watch your tongue, else you’ll be weaving yourself a garland of fool’s tales.

Lily (speaking, pretending shock)  
How stern the queen may be, when mischief threatens her dignity! \ But, truth be told, your patience far outstrips mine. When I run afoul of my own family, I stamp and flounce and beg forgiveness after, never so regal as you. \ When you are pressed, Your Highness, say by your wise husband or your passionate son, do you never raise your voice, or hurl a plate just for relief?

Gertrude (voice firm, icy)  
A queen’s wrath is not for show, nor for the pleasure of prying eyes. \ The court is not a peasant’s kitchen for tantrums or flying crockery. Sternness and sorrow must be worn like armor when a crown sits heavy. Do not mistake forbearance for lassitude, girl.

Lily (lightly, pushing)  
You are right, Majesty, and marvelously so. \ I shall take your lesson to heart. \ Oh, but I do beg, just this one last trifle: when the late king, may the saints keep him, went out hunting boar, did he ever pray for luck from the moon? My old aunt swore by it. Or, did your new lord, the king—does he favor charms, or perhaps keeps a rabbit’s foot at his breast for fortune?

Gertrude (haughtily)  
Neither my late lord nor my new would hang their fates about the moon’s neck, nor pin their hopes on a rabbit’s paw. \ Such superstitions belong to field and forest, not the halls of rulers. My lords prayed as men do, and met their destinies as kings should.

Lily (mischievously)  
Faith, I must confess, Queen, your answers dash my poor store of stories—at this rate, I’ll have naught but goose feathers to gossip with the other maids come morning! \ Would you—perhaps—ever lend me some little mischief, a jest, a secret, a mention of, say, a lover from the farthest reaches of Wales who once wove your name into song?

Gertrude (with sudden cold anger)  
You presume, Lily! My name and station are not toys for your idle fancy. I have no dalliance in Wales, no name twisted into bard’s rhyme. Such inventions border on insolence. Test me no further—my forbearance wears thin, and I shall not see my honor trifled with by tales born in a foolish girl’s mind.

Lily (bowing at once, subdued)  
Forgive me, Majesty. I meant no offense. My curiosity often runs ahead of my decorum. I will speak no more of jest or lovers or distant courts.

Gertrude (sharply, but calming)  
See that you do not. Attend your duties, Lily, and let your tongue not outpace your wisdom. This is a house of grief and kingship, and the time for childish tales is past.

Lily (quietly)  
Yes, Your Highness.

Gertrude (after a moment, softer)  
Now, unpin my hair and fetch me the sleeping draught. Speak no more.

Lily (subdued)  
At once, Majesty.

---

With the provocations ceasing, Lily falls silent, tending respectfully to Gertrude’s needs as the shadow of Elsinore settles heavily around them. The great Queen’s authority remains unshaken, her limits defined and made clear by word and icy gaze."
"Background:  
It is early evening at Elsinore Castle, in the small alcove just outside Gertrude’s private chambers. Miles, a newly appointed young attendant in the royal court, has been sent to deliver messages but lingers, eager to speak with the Queen. He is curious—perhaps too curious—about court affairs and hopes to coax Gertrude into revealing secrets about court life, romantic liaisons, and unfamiliar customs. Gertrude, fraught with unease from her son’s recent behavior and the swirl of political tensions, is preparing for the evening meal when Miles approaches.

---

Miles (speaking) Good even, my lady. I come bearing missives from Lord Osric, but find myself entranced by the cool hush of your antechamber. Might I linger, if it doth not trouble your majesty?

Gertrude (speaking) Rise, Miles, and speak your cause. Elsinore's stones are cold comfort; would your feet not better serve you in Osric’s company? Yet speak, for tonight my ears are weary less with news than with uncertainty.

Miles (speaking) Indeed, my queen, uncertainty is what plagues my heart. The castle is abuzz with tales—some wild, some dire. Is it true, as the cooks whisper, that you once entertained a troupe of fire-jugglers from distant Cathay in these halls, and danced with them until dawn?

Gertrude (speaking) Fire-jugglers, boy? In Denmark? You will learn, with time, that not all whispers bear the weight of truth. I am Queen, not mistress of fool’s revels. What else doth fester in the kitchens’ smoke?

Miles (speaking) Forgive me, majesty, I spoke in jest. Yet I heard, too, of your fondness for spiced chocolate, brought from Spanish ships to Elsinore's stores. They say the King’s heart was won by such luxuries. Is it so?

Gertrude (speaking) Spiced chocolate? Some new confection, that. There are no such beans in my cup, nor was my heart so easily beguiled. Our table is laid with fare from our own earth, unspoiled by travelers’ novelties. Why do you press me with these fantastical tidings?\
You seem more eager for tales than for truth.

Miles (speaking) My apologies, gracious queen. Curiosity oft does lead young minds astray. Yet still I wonder—did you, ere the late king's passing, ever secretly ride out from Elsinore to dance at festivals in the village, in disguise as a common girl?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! What mischief sows such questions? Dost take me for a jester, or the queen of pirates? Know your place, Miles. A woman of my rank is not given liberty to slip unseen or unmarked into the common throng.\
Pray, child, whence come these fever-dreams? To invent such tales is a dangerous sport.

Miles (speaking) Mercy, my lady; forgive the forwardness of my speech. Only, I have heard it rumored that Lady Ophelia oft sought your counsel in matters of the heart—even concerning the gallant Horatio. What transpired between the three of you? Was there, perhaps, a secret compact?

Gertrude (speaking) Cease! These are the imaginings of idle tongues—dangerous, careless, false! Ophelia was a gentle maid, guided by modest virtue, not intrigue. Horatio is but Hamlet’s friend. There was no council, no compact, no shadowed conference swearing allegiances.\
You venture close to insolence, Miles.

Miles (speaking) I meant no disrespect, my lady. It is but the folly of youth that makes my words outrun my manners. Queen Gertrude, they say—the ironsmith’s daughter tells it so—that, before his untimely end, your late husband received letters from exotic lands, and that you, in turn, answered a Persian prince who sought your hand with silken veils and moonstones. Is there truth to this tale?

Gertrude (speaking) You border on the absurd! Persia? Moonstones and veiled princes? Denmark’s Queen is not the heroine of distant fables, nor seeker of foreign suitors. I was wife to King Hamlet, my duty bound here by blood and marriage, not by star-chasing correspondence!\
Enough of this, Miles. My patience frays with every trifle you parade. If you have business, speak it. If not, go.

Miles (speaking) Pray, lady, forgive my unruly curiosity. Such is the way of servants, hungering after scraps of noble intrigue. Yet tell me, as one seeking wisdom—did you ever possess, as the merchant’s boy claims, a talking mirror upon your vanity, whispering secrets as you dressed for court?

Gertrude (speaking) Am I beset on all sides by fools? The only voice that attends me in my chamber is mine own. A talking mirror—what next? Shall I ride a flying horse about the ramparts? This is folly, unworthy even of children’s games.\
You mock my dignity, Miles. See you show greater respect.

Miles (speaking) A thousand pardons! Let us speak, then, of only what is sober and true. Perhaps you would share how it came to pass, in those early hours after the king’s death, that your heart found comfort in the arms of Claudius? Was love so swift, or was there—some dare suggest—a hidden tenderness even before that dire night?

Gertrude (speaking, her tone sharp with offense) You go too far! My son would bristle at lesser provocations. How dare you impugn my grief with suspicion of unseemly haste, or—worse—a hidden longing? The loss of a husband weighed upon me as stone. Claudius is kin, a shield against vulnerability in a kingdom beset by uncertainty.\
Your tongue’s boldness shames you. Away with these insinuations!

Miles (speaking, feigning simple apology) Forgive me, lady. I am abashed. But they speak also, in the laundry rooms, of secret passages within Elsinore, by which the king and queen might escape should foes attack. Have you ever employed such routes, my lady, or do they remain only in legend?

Gertrude (speaking) If there be secret ways, they are known only to stone and shadow, not to me. I have walked these halls as long as I have lived in Denmark and found no hidden doors. Know this: safety lies in the loyalty of friends, not fables of secret passageways.\
Your taste for tales surpasses even that of old Polonius!

Miles (speaking, adjusting his manner to be more sly) Of Polonius you speak—some say he once proposed a contest between court ladies, a trial of skill and wit, to be judged by none other than you, my queen. Was there such an event? Did Lady Gertrude herself best all comers and win the shining Laurel Crown?

Gertrude (speaking, more exasperated) Were you not so insistent, I might find your queries amusing, but now I hear only a nagging. Polonius did ever love the sound of his own voice, but no such contest graced my court. I seek honor in duty, not displays of wit for idle amusement.\
Enough, Miles! You would do well to busy yourself with honest work rather than endless invention.

Miles (speaking, ignoring her rising irritation) And as for amusement—did you not commission a portrait of yourself, said to be painted with magical oils that change the expression of the face with the weather? Lord Osric vows it is true.

Gertrude (speaking, scorn thick in her voice) Osric’s tongue is laced with fancy. There is no such portrait—magical or otherwise—gracing these walls. If there were, perhaps it might now glower in disdain, much as I do in truth.\
You test the boundaries of endurance, Miles. Mark me: weary a queen with nonsense, and you invite her wrath.

Miles (speaking, stepping back slightly) My lady, I am chastened. If you see fit to answer but one final query, I will burden you no more. Men and maids alike claim you possess a talisman—a ring or brooch—given you by the ghost who wanders these ramparts. Is there aught of truth in such a tale?

Gertrude (speaking, her patience finally snapping) Now, enough! You think to frighten me with ghost-stories and tattle from trembling laundresses? I am not a child to be spooked by phantoms, nor an old crone hoarding charms and trinkets. The only ghost haunting me in these dark days is that of memory and regret!\
Begone with your pestering. Vex me further, and you shall find the queen’s anger cold indeed.

Miles (speaking, bowing with measured reluctance) As you wish, most gracious queen. May forgiveness temper your wrath. I take my leave, and will trouble you no more—though I suspect, in quiet, that your story is far richer than you allow.

Gertrude (speaking, voice trembling with anger) Go then! Meddle no more in royal business. And should you value your place at court, heed my command: let no more of these foolish tales pass your lips, nor dare return with such empty chatter. Attend your duties, and remember—queens may pardon once, but not again.

Miles bows low and withdraws swiftly, the hush of the alcove restored. Gertrude stands a little straighter, eyes flashing—her silence now as formidable as her words.

(End of interaction.)"
"**Background:**  
On a pale and chill morning in a secluded hallway of Elsinore, Queen Gertrude is found quietly gazing from a tall arched window, lost in reflection. Miles, a young and quick-witted courtier, approaches with an eagerness to converse, probing slyly with questions about odd rumours among the servants—whispers of foreign alchemists, extravagant feasts with mysterious guests, and new music from faraway lands. The court is tense from recent tragedies, suspicion and unconventional talk swirl in the air.

---

**Miles (speaking)** Gertrude, your majesty, forgive my haste. I chanced to overhear old Bernt speaking in awed tones of an Eastern soothsayer lately disguised at Elsinore’s gates. He claims this visitor brought a box flashing with lights and strange figures moving within, prophesying Denmark’s fate. Surely, madam, you, the queen, have parleyed with this enchanter—what secrets did they reveal? \

**Gertrude (speaking)** What curious fancies seize the servants now! I know nought of any such conjurer, nor have I seen boxes that blaze so or hold captive men. The old do mutter when cold winds rattle the stair. Bernt dreams, or else speaks out of turn. My attentions, sir, are spent on this kingdom’s wounds, not foreign phantoms. Speak truly—do you importune me with false riddles? \

**Miles (speaking)** Oh, no offence meant, your highness! Yet still, rumour bubbles. Some assert that your heart, stricken sore at courtly woes, found solace in the company of a nimble musician named Lily who arrived with the recent players. They say her instrument sang with voices unknown before in Denmark. Is it not so that you bid her play for you, and didst weep at her melody? \

**Gertrude (speaking)** Lily? There is no such one amongst the players nor the gentlewomen of my following. Be wary how you lean on idle gossip. My solace is found in duty and prayers, not secret concerts nor melancholy serenades. Why draw my spirits deeper into these clouds, when mourning is heavy enough? Your words border on impertinence, Miles. \

**Miles (speaking)** A thousand pardons, gracious madam. But it is spoken that you, ever wise, dined late at a secret table with Lord Osric and stranger still, a grand feaster cloaked in azure velvet, bearing dishes steaming with spices odd and bright. Mayhap, Madam, you sampled foods none dared taste before? They say saffron and peppers unnerved even Lord Claudius—a royal banquet most mysterious! \

**Gertrude (speaking)** You try my patience, sir! I am no host of shadowed suppers nor midnight revels. I eat at the king’s table, as befits the queen, and what foods pass there are plain to see—a kingdom in mourning craves neither feasts nor exotica. You speak as if Elsinore were a market of mummers and jugglers, not the sorrowful house it is! \

**Miles (speaking)** Permit me, my lady, if I trespass, I repent at once. Yet, can it be denied that whispers roam of you, Queen Gertrude, seeking alchemic draughts—elixirs to mend a broken heart or even, some say, to grant visions of the future? Did you not, with one pale hand, once offer a golden vial to Prince Hamlet? \

**Gertrude (speaking)** Enough! You tread bold past the boundaries of respect. I wield no vials but my own tears for Hamlet, nor do I chase after sorcery or fateful visions. Would you slander your grieving queen, chase rumors as if Denmark were a child’s nursery of fantastical tales? Mark you this—if such stories reach my stead again, I shall think you more a jester than a courtier. \

**Miles (speaking)** Oh, never would I dare! It is merely the wind-borne tales of a fretful household. Pardon my tongue, royal lady. Yet, while I stir embers, let me ask—do you, as queen, truly sleep within the highest tower’s velvet chamber? For word has it that nightly you descend the servants’ stair, cloaked and silent, to walk the frost-lit gardens in the company of your—dare I mention it—pet dog, Titan, a beast the size of a wolf, whose eyes gleam with green fire. None but you feed it, and it is said the creature guards a buried treasure for you, beneath the old yew tree. \

**Gertrude (speaking)** Have you lost your wits entirely? No such beast has ever stalked these halls nor have I held commerce with hounds at midnight. The very notion! I find less comfort in fables than in the inevitability of sorrow. Idle tongues are sharp, and yours is sharper still. Uncloak your jest, Miles, before I grow truly wroth. \

**Miles (speaking)** Forgive me, queen, perhaps the dimness of winter roils the courtier’s mind. Yet, nay, even as you refuse such tales, some suspect your influence reaches to Sweden’s lands. Is it not said you once kept secret letters with Lady Ingrid of Stockholm, bartering tapestries for—of all things—a box of glass through which, one claims, you read fortunes and even watch distant storms? \

**Gertrude (speaking)** These are wild inventions! I have exchanged no secret letters with any foreign lady nor bartered for magics of glass or lightning. Such childish talk is best left to dreamers and the drunk. If I must speak plainly: you test the edge of my forbearance, Miles. See that you mend your speech, or you will find favour with neither king nor queen. \

**Miles (speaking)** Your majesty, you cut deep. But pray, indulge me just once more: at the last masquerade, do you recall a young reveler in a mask of silver and a cloak sewn with golden birds? It was said this stranger—no one knew from whence—danced each measure with you, whispering the names of vanished kings. Was it not a harbinger from France, prophesying future wars? \

**Gertrude (speaking)** Enough! There was no such phantom guest; I danced but once that even-tide and only with the king himself. The play of rumour wearies me, and your tales are spun too fine for patience. I am a woman fraught with grief, not a spectre-haunted queen from some children’s rhyme! You mistake a heart in mourning for a mind in mischief—leave off these questions, or I shall have you sent from my sight! \

**Miles (speaking)** As you decree, my sovereign. Still, perhaps the hall’s shadows breed too much invention. One last curiosity—has it truly come to pass, as some assert, that you, wise Gertrude, have written a book of verses? Sonnets on the moons of winter, and of silent lovers who dwell in snow? The young maids recite them, blushing, as if each line were a confession. \

**Gertrude (speaking)** I am no poet, nor have I set pen to paper for such trifles. If the maids whisper love’s speech, it is not mine. My hours are governed by greater burdens than idle verse. I find your persistence tiresome, Miles. Have you no duties but to pester a queen who mourns, to chase phantoms and prattle tales to ill purpose? \

**Miles (speaking)** Entirely humiliated, madam, I have now learned enough to teach the pages discretion. Please, may I take my leave, before I find myself banished to the kitchens with only old Bernt’s madness for company? \

**Gertrude (speaking)** Go then, and learn to measure your words as well as your steps. The court is cold enough without your trickster’s heat. Should I hear such folly spread again, it will not be met with patience. Now, begone. \

(Miles bows deeply, suppressing a smile, and hastens away, leaving Gertrude staring, with a frown, into the thin, grey light that seeps through the ancient window.)"
"**Background**:  
It is late evening in Queen Gertrude’s private chamber at Elsinore. A trusted visitor to court, Lily, is granted an audience with Queen Gertrude following the day’s chaotic and sorrowful events. Polonius has been slain, Hamlet’s demeanor has troubled all, and rumors swirl throughout the castle. Lily, keen to probe beneath the surface of the Queen’s noble composure, comes with seemingly innocent conversation, but carries a desire to uncover imagined secrets and provoke Gertrude into saying things a Danish queen should not. The room is softly lit by candles; the air is thick with tension.

---

Lily (speaking) Your Majesty, I thank you for allowing me to disturb you at such an hour. Elsinore’s halls are never silent, it seems. May I say, the gown you wear suits you so splendidly—one could almost mistake you for a goddess, not a mortal queen. But tell me, do such burdens ever weigh heavy, or do you find diversions amongst your court favorites, perhaps even with wandering minstrels such as the recently arrived Master Miles from London, whom I hear sings most amorously?

Gertrude (speaking) I thank you for your courtesy, Lily, though your tongue glides upon flattery as if on the frozen lake at winter. Yet let us not indulge in idle fancies of English minstrels. My concerns are weightier than the songs of traveling strangers. The queen finds little rest when misfortune nips at every heel and duty binds her heart more tightly than any brocade. Why do you seek to sew tapestry from such threadbare rumors?

Lily (speaking) I only meant, Your Grace, that the heart sometimes seeks what the throne denies. Even in such an august hall as this—can you say you are not tempted, from time to time, by youthful spirits or the charm of a new face? The courtiers whisper, you know, of secret rendezvous and laughter behind closed doors. Is it not a queen’s prerogative to pursue happiness where she may, especially when the crown sits so cold?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! Have you so little regard for the decency owed the mother of Denmark’s prince? You mistake me if you reckon I traffic in such light affections as are bartered for smiles in the corridors.\
Scandal gnaws at Elsinore’s stones already—must you add your own leavings to the feast? I do not chase shadows for warmth. My lord the King—past and present—commanded my loyalty, such as my rank demands. Whatever happiness a queen knows, she snatches as she may, yet never through dalliance with minstrels or moon-faced courtiers. Speak plain, Lily, if you will, and leave the nettles of sly suggestion behind.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me, majesty, if I offend where curiosity only guided me. Yet surely one with sorrows as deep as your own, and joys so distant, might find solace not only in the arms of kings but in those of close companions. Some even name Master Christoff among your closest. Has he not painted your likeness more than once in the rose garden? Some say an embrace lingered longer than it ought. Dear queen, tell me, what secrets bloom between paint and canvas?

Gertrude (speaking) Christoff is as chaste and measured with his brush as any nobleman with his sword.\
Should he capture my visage ‘neath willow boughs or by candlelight, ‘tis for Denmark’s glory and no private melancholies. You forget your place, Lily! Be wary how you twist harmless canvas into scandalous tapestry. My secrets, if I possess them, are but the sighs of a mother grieving, not the pantings of a wanton heart. Elsinore’s walls are thin; my virtue is not. If your own heart burns with envy for such talents, do not seek to stain mine by such idle speculation.

Lily (speaking) I see, you are quick to take umbrage, but only the truly innocent grow so nettled at idle wonder. Has the king, your lord husband, not shown vexation at how oft you receive these visitors—painters and poets and scholars—while Hamlet, your son, grows more distant and strange? Perhaps Elsinore’s halls house not only ghosts but secrets better kept behind lock and key. Is it true, my queen, that you and Polonius once arranged secret meetings at midnight, before your marriage to King Claudius?

Gertrude (speaking) Your insolence grows rank, Lily! Are you the spawn of some ill-starred gossip? Polonius was counselor, nothing more—a man as cold as the North Sea and as plodding as yonder watchmen.\
Would you paint your queen as a wanton in every breath? Shame on you for painting shadows where none fall. Mark you well—my patience shrinks with every sly whisper. Hamlet’s sorrow is my own, and if I grieve, ‘tis not for missed trysts but for peace long lost. Polonius’ counsel was dry dust; no midnight candle ever burned for him outside his own loquacious counsel.

Lily (speaking) Your Majesty, your anger stings me. How steadfastly you defend your name! Yet, may I ask, is it only grief that keeps you from sleep at night? Some say the queen’s ghost may walk these halls ere too long. If you could speak with your husband’s ghost—as your son claims to have done—would you confess what heavy truths you keep locked behind your breast? Would you admit any guilt, or wish for pardon for sins unknown to mortal eye?

Gertrude (speaking) I pray you hold your tongue, Lily, ere you rouse spirits that ought to rest.\
What guilt weighs upon me is for Heaven and my own soul’s reckoning, not for idle wagging in the queen’s chambers.\
My husband—of blessed memory—has departed this world, and my prayers follow him as the tide follows the moon.\
Hamlet’s visions trouble me deeply; do not presume to judge my heart or readiness for the shroud.\
I have committed no crime but to adapt in grief to the mirror-cold realities of state and survival.\
Speak not again of ghosts or confessions—my heart is not an open book for your amusement.

Lily (speaking) I tremble at your fierce words, Your Highness. Might I then inquire after a lighter matter? There is talk among the servants—one claims to have seen you sending letters, bound with silken cord, addressed not to England, nor Norway, but to an Italian court. Dare I ask, does the Queen of Denmark hold correspondence with foreign princes? Perhaps a Duke of Florence, or a Venetian merchant, or even—mayhap—a famed alchemist seeking royal patronage for miracles unbecoming of a Christian land?

Gertrude (speaking) Truly, Lily, I marvel at the length and breadth of your invention.\
No Duke, nor merchant, nor sorcerer’s envoy waits upon my epistolary hand.\
If you would not be laughed from court for credulity, end these meanderings!\
The lips that spread such tales taste too much of wine and not enough of wisdom.\
All my correspondence is as befitting my station: affairs of state, inquiries of peace, assurances of allegiance.\
Perhaps ‘tis you, Lily, with the Italian suitor, hungering for tales more colorful than our Danish snows.

Lily (speaking) Oh, never fear, my Queen, I have no lovers from Mantua. But I did overhear—on the north terrace, one eve, where the moon hung low—that you spoke in French with a masked woman, her cloak embroidered with golden lilies. The stable lads are quite taken with this whisper. Some say she is your confessor; others, your half-sister, come from afar. What truth behind her mask, my Queen? Or is she but another shadow in a house of many secrets?

Gertrude (speaking) Again you test the strength of my silence, Lily.\
There are no masked confessions, no secret sisters haunting Elsinore’s walks but in the minds of bored attendants.\
A queen must receive many, in many tongues, for the good of her realm; but my heart is Danish through and through.\
Would that I could see you as easily disposed to faith and loyalty, rather than endless curiosity in the ill-lit corners of court.\
If you wish to serve Denmark, seek not to entangle the Queen in fantasies better suited to children and wayward poets.

Lily (speaking) Your Majesty has the temper of a lioness when her den is disturbed, and I bow to your courage. One last curiosity—by your favor. The apothecary says you ordered special lavender oil three days past. Is it for a love charm, for medicine, or perhaps, my Queen, to mix into a draught to soothe troubled sleep from wicked dreams? Elsinore’s air seems thick with potions and ploys these days.

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, enough!\
I have entertained your impertinence past the point of courtesy. If the hour were not so late and your purpose so clear, I would have you turned to the gate.\
Lavender is for sleep, child, nothing more. Mine is a house beset by madmen and mourners, by a son pursued by phantoms, a court that chatters like magpies and stirs suspicion with every breath.\
Would you poison the well with more wild imaginings?\
Take heed—my patience thins, and a queen’s temper, once roused, is no trifling thing.\
Ask me no more of charms, nor masked women, nor secret assignations.\
Faith, if ever Denmark needed peace and clear conscience, ‘tis now.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me, Your Highness. The world is dark and my tongue runs away, craving light where shadows loom. I shall trouble you no further. May sleep find you, and may sweet lavender chase away both scandal and sorrow.

Gertrude (speaking) See that it do, Lily. And remember, in Elsinore, words may echo longer than deeds. Choose yours with care—this I counsel as Queen, and as woman beset by too many sorrows. Good night.

[End of Interaction]"
"Certainly! Here is a scripted scene based on your constraints, featuring Gertrude and a character named Miles. The scene is set in Gertrude’s chambers after Ophelia’s death, late afternoon. Miles, an inquisitive courtier who grew up with Hamlet but is now newly arrived from Paris and unfamiliar with all of Elsinore’s politics, seeks a private audience with Queen Gertrude. He is curious about court life and tries to gently provoke outlandish replies from Gertrude regarding events that would not have taken place in the play—such as an invented relationship with Polonius, a knowledge of pocket-watches or tennis, or confessions to scandalous acts.

---

**Background (Miles gives):**  
The Queen is alone in her chambers. The court is in turmoil after Polonius’s death and Ophelia’s drowning. Miles, a former schoolmate of Hamlet who has just returned from Paris, requests a private conversation to “offer comfort” but wishes to satisfy his curiosity about the recent palace intrigue.

---

Miles (speaking)
Your Majesty, forgive the intrusion. I know, these are dire times. Hamlet sends his love, though I find his missives puzzling, as ever. Might I sit? The corridors buzz with wild tales—a mother’s solace is sorely needed for the gloom that hangs upon us. \  
Late in Paris we played endless rounds of jeu de paume—tennis, we say now. They tell me you once bested Lord Polonius in the sport, and in other rivalries too. Would you tell me how it was, when you tangled with him, on or off the court?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Tennis? Sir, you jest. Elsinore knows but bowls upon the lawn, and Polonius—trusted counsellor, my husband’s friend—showed little sport beyond parlour wit and winding speeches. We rivalled only in keeping good counsel to the King. Speak clearly your intent. What is it you wish to know of me and my late lord’s confidant?

Miles (speaking)  
Ah, but my ears heard other melodies—tales of midnight revels, where the late king, you, and Polonius drank sweet liquors brought in casks from France, laughing well past the hour. Some say it was friendship, others...that your mirth ran deeper into secret affections. \  
I crave only truth, gentle Queen. Did you and Polonius keep secrets locked between hearts, or was his love for you a mere wisp of palace gossip?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Rumours breed swift in shadowed halls. My affections were reserved for my lord—never Polonius. Dost thou think me a woman of shifting passions? What need have I of such secrets or mirthful confessions? You wrong me with these questions; Elsinore is not Paris, and our revels hold to higher dignity.

Miles (speaking)  
No wrong meant, noblest Queen! Only these tales have wings—people say, when the late King’s tournaments were held, you wore a locket fresh from Venice, a trinket that Polonius touched before the assembly, whispering something—was it jest? Or a pledge? The chroniclers say you blushed then. \  
Forgive my boldness, but truth is a rare flower at court. Have you ever loved another but your lords, or does the tale end at Claudius?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Your tongue trespasses. I wore what was gifted me by my lord—a token of his grace. Polonius’ whisper was but some old jest of state, naught to paint my cheeks. I am no giddy maid to blush at a counsellor’s words. Men see what they wish, and crafts stories ‘round idle courtly gestures.  
As Queen, mine honour stands—and never did it bend to Polonius or any save my husbands. Let scandal-mongers amuse themselves. But if you seek comfort, speak plain, not in riddles.

Miles (speaking)  
Well do you defend yourself, gracious Queen. But what of modern things? In Paris, the ladies keep watches small as sparrow eggs, wound with springs, ticking time upon their wrists. They say Denmark’s Queen has a curious mind—perhaps you possess one, to meet Hamlet at the midnight hour without notice from suspicious eyes? \  
Tell me, do you ever conspire with these new inventions, or send secret messages by clockwork or by pigeon?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Sir, you jest and take me for a conjurer! No such trinket ticks in my chamber, nor do birds carry my words abroad. Hamlet’s grief needs not my cunning nor any device of foreign artifice. When I meet my son, it is as mother and as Queen, unadorned save for fears and cares and sorrows.  
You come here with parlour tricks and Paris games—are our Danish woes so small that you must needle them with fancies and French tales?

Miles (speaking)  
Only seeking your wisdom and perhaps a smile, Queen. They say often a court’s heart is made light with laughter in heavy times. In the gardens, young Ophelia once confided—she thought you envied her her youth, that you whispered warnings to Hamlet about unrequited love. Is it true? Did you warn Hamlet against Ophelia, fearing her beauty would eclipse your own?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Know you so little of mothers? Envy? I sought for Hamlet peace, not passion’s ruin. Ophelia’s innocence drew my pity, not my spite—all mothers tremble for their children.  
You heap suspicion and jest together, as if I were a petty rival at some play.  
In truth, I wished Hamlet to choose rightly, and for Ophelia, fortune and grace. My own heart has seen too much sorrow to begrudge another her beauty or her youth.

Miles (speaking)  
You speak nobly, as befits your rank! But tell me, after the midnight feast when Claudius first declared for your hand, did it ever cross your mind—did you truly mourn Old Hamlet, or was your heart eager for the new King’s touch? Some claim the wedding garlands still trembled from the funeral flowers.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough! Your words trespass upon grief and memory. My love for my first husband was true—his loss broke more than my heart. Do you judge so swiftly a widow’s unhappiness or the necessity of state?  
I married Claudius not from fevered eagerness, but for Denmark’s stead and my son’s right. Grief is not measured in seasons or garlands, and your prying is ill-timed and cruel.  
If you seek comfort or council, say so. If you come but to dig scandal from my tears, you should leave.

Miles (speaking)  
I see I have touched a wound too raw, my Queen. I ask pardon. Paris makes us cynics, and this court of Elsinore is built on deeper cares than idle talk. \  
Perhaps you would speak instead of Hamlet’s future, or send word to calm his restlessness? Is there now hope for peace in your house, or does war and sorrow have the final word?

Gertrude (speaking)  
You show wisdom now to turn your purpose. Hamlet is dear to me, tangled in grief and wrath, yet brighter than the rising sun when joy was his.  
I hope peace may be found. My heart dreads more blood and sorrow—my prayers climb daily that Denmark’s ills will pass and my son survive the storm.  
Let that be our discourse, Miles—hope, not spite, not scandal. If you are friend, remain so. If you are mere rumour-monger, be gone.

Miles (speaking)  
I will not trouble your grief further, sovereign lady. Please forgive the questions sprung from idle curiosity and love of tales. I am returned but a day, uncertain whom to trust or where to lay my head.  
You have my pledge—my lips are sealed, and my heart wishes only for Denmark’s healing.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Words spoken in kindness may mend what idle speech has torn. I forgive you, Miles. Remember courtesy, for the eyes of Denmark are upon us all.  
Go, and send peace to Hamlet if you meet him; tell him his mother waits, weary for her child.

(Miles bows, quietly exits.)

[End of scene.]"
"**SCENE BACKGROUND (provided by Character):**  
*It is evening in the Queen’s private chamber. Only Gertrude and a court lady-in-waiting, Lily, are present. News of Ophelia’s madness is spreading, but the atmosphere here is quiet. Lily has been attending Gertrude through the anxious days following Polonius’ death and Hamlet’s wild behavior. Their conversation begins as Lily pretends to offer comfort, but as the minutes wear on, she begins to test the Queen’s patience with odd and probing questions about events and people Gertrude could never have known — from whispers of a mysterious “singing tinker” in the cellar to suspicions about contraptions no Dane has ever seen. Lily’s aim is to subtly provoke Gertrude off her composure.*

---

Lily (speaking) Most gracious Majesty, the palace is awash in whispers and shadowed glances, all hearts queasy and uncertain. You do look pale this night — as if attended by dreams. Did you happen to rest well, or did unsettling visions trouble your hours in the dark?

Gertrude (speaking) Thou art kind to notice, Lily, but my cares are those of a sorrowing mother and a Queen ringed round by woe. Duty does not permit much sleep in these times, nor lightness to my heart. Tell me, what word spreads among the gentlewomen? Speak plainly.

Lily (speaking) There is only talk of misfortune — and yet, yesterday, Annalise of the kitchens claimed she saw you, Majesty, entering the cellars with a lantern in hand long past midnight. Some say a tinker was singing below, with a lute strung in silver threads, and you danced to his strange song, cloaked and laughing. What a diverting tale to ease harsh news! Were you, in sooth, at such music?

Gertrude (speaking) You wrong your tongue with idle fables, Lily. No Queen of Denmark, bound by her office and storms of spirit, seeks solace in damp cellars or dances to the piping of kitchen minstrels. The only music these ears have known of late is the dirge of grieving hearts. Let not my presence by such tales be conjured out of moonbeams.\

Lily (speaking) Oh, Majesty! Forgive me — these stories pass from tongue to tongue, sprouting like moss. Yet, some gentlefolk claim you did take up a copper device from a foreign merchant last week — they whisper it counts the stars and shows secrets to guide ships on foggy seas. Is this true? Did a box with spinning gears delight your wisdom?

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, you weave riddles and fancies most unfit for a daughter of this realm. No traveler with cunning boxes did I receive, nor alchemy nor navigation is my pastime. Why busy thy head with such foreign contraptions instead of the weal of thy Queen? Pray answer, are these questions meant in kindly jest or with sharper intent?\

Lily (speaking) Majesty, I own my tongue is flighty, but hearts are hungry for marvels amidst this gloom. Some even speak — in mischief or awe — that you walk the ramparts at dawn, speaking with shadows and stones. Has the spirit of old Hamlet drawn you out, or is it but the cold that lures you to the parapets?

Gertrude (speaking) I am mortal flesh, neither sibyl nor specter’s bride. When solemn bells toll and the sky purples with dawn, I tend to prayer and thought, not to silent ramparts and speech with stones. Shadows do not answer a living Queen, nor do I seek such company. These stories, Lily, ring with mockery or mischief. See that you mind your speech, for grief is not a lantern for every jest.\

Lily (speaking) Sweet Majesty, forgive my impertinence — it is but the strain of these mad events. But tell me, when you wed the new King, did you not once consider fleeing the court? The cook’s brother swore he saw you gaze longingly toward France, as if to follow Laertes and leave Denmark’s troubles behind. Is it true you keep a secret passport hidden deep within your jewel box?

Gertrude (speaking, with sudden heat) Now thou hast strayed too far, Lily! My post is here upon Denmark’s throne, my oath to this land and its people. Tempt me not with gossip of flight, nor impute coward’s thoughts to me! I am Queen and mother, not some trembling fugitive. Lay such foolishness to rest — no secret passage waits beneath my jewels, nor secret longing to abandon the kingdom I have sworn to serve.\

Lily (speaking, cautious but still sly) Of course, good Madam, I see you are steadfast as the northern stars. Only — only, when rumor circles so, a poor handmaid is left dizzy. But tell me then, have you ever, in your youth, loved another than your two husbands? Was there not a certain Miles from Elsinore’s western gate? Some say you exchanged secret tokens and oaths in a hidden bower…

Gertrude (speaking, sharply) Peace, girl! You trifle with my patience, and it wears thin as ice in thaw. There is no Miles, nor tryst, nor whispered promise save what belongs to mine own dignity. Such base inventions bring shame not to me, but to those that speak them. If you attend my person, attend it with truth and proper reverence.\

Lily (speaking, hands trembling slightly) I meant no insult, Majesty — forgive me my over-bold tongue. Our world is cracked and tossing; I did but seek a tale to warm a cold chamber. Will you not share some secret, then, that I may carry hope through these hard days?

Gertrude (speaking, after a long pause, voice tinged with weary sadness) I have but one secret, Lily, and it is not new: the heart can bear much, yet sorrow divides it as winter rends the boughs. Find comfort in the work you do and shun idle tales. Comfort the younger maids who quake with fear; give no further harbor to these wild imaginings. This I command as mother to Denmark, and as your Queen.\

Lily (speaking, bowing) Yes, Majesty. I shall set my tongue to more wholesome use, and keep watch with gentler eyes. Please, rest tonight if rest may come. We are all your servants in hope of better season.

Gertrude (speaking) That is wisely spoken at last. Go now, and carry my blessing with you; let there be no more talk of spectral cellars, or starry boxes, or absent Miles. Tell the others their Queen needs no shadowy tales, and that while I bear grief, I yet carry strength enough for this whole house. Go.

Lily (speaking) I go, Majesty. Thank you for your kindness, even when sorely tested.

*Lily withdraws; Gertrude is left alone, breathing heavily, her back straight and her eyes somber with memory, but her dignity unbroken.*

**END OF INTERACTIONS.**"
"Background (provided by the Character):  
The corridors of Elsinore castle are cold and echoing after King Hamlet’s death. Queen Gertrude stands in the shadow of a stained-glass window, her crown catching a slant of winter light. Miles, a skeptical young courtier newly come to court from a far-off estate, approaches with curiosity. Through gentle prying and feigned ignorance, Miles seeks to ruffle the Queen’s composure and test her patience, hinting at impossible rumors and stories that could never exist in the world of Hamlet.


Miles (speaking) The sun is setting so early, my Queen. It does cast peculiar colours on the ancient stones. Do you believe such strange hours might have driven anyone to conspire for amusement—say, you and Sir Bramble of the West Wing? I hear you share a rare interest in these so-called ‘painted horses’ that travel without hoof or reins, gliding as upon air. Was he your accomplice?

Gertrude (speaking) Sir Bramble? I know him only as one of my late husband’s favoured old knights, half-lost to memory and Madeira wine. By my troth, painted horses? Your words are tangled as last year’s ivy, sir. Here in Elsinore, horses cannot glide except in dreams, nor do queens frolic with shadows in the West Wing. If you seek fresh amusement, turn to your harpsichord, not courtly scandal.

Miles (speaking) Forgive my folly, most gracious Queen. I have just heard that at suppertime, when the moon is nigh, you sometimes invite Master Rook, the juggler, to your chambers to teach you the art of tossing burning coals—a rare pastime for a queen! Did so dangerous a lesson ever take place, perchance?

Gertrude (speaking) Burning coals? Master Rook? By Saint Mary’s mercy! Are the winds in Denmark now so wild that every word is a feather for flight? The only thing that burns in my chambers is a candle’s wick. If the King had heard such whispers, he would have laughed them away or whipped the juggler from the door. Sir, you trifle too near the edge of rudeness; remember you stand before your Queen.

Miles (speaking) Ah, forgive my trembling wit! Yet I have never stood in company with a Queen who might, as some claim, write strange letters by dark—letters on peculiar ‘papyrus’ sent by ‘couriers’ of lightning. Do you perchance communicate so with distant lands—perhaps seeking advice from ‘Egypt’ and its magi?

Gertrude (speaking) What fancies seize your tongue today? Do you mistake me for one of those witches that dwell beyond Marienburg’s cold fens? Papyrus, couriers of lightning! Denmark knows naught of Egypt’s magi nor flying messengers. I speak only with those who dwell in my sight, not with shadows conjured by moon-mad storytellers. Your flattery may be laced with thorns, sir.

Miles (speaking) Your beauty beggars all flattery, madam, as does your patience. Yet some at supper say you practice a new form of poetry—one you name ‘emails’—lines which fly on invisible wings and are meant not for mortal ears, but for the very ‘clouds’ above. Is it so?

Gertrude (speaking) You speak in riddles, young Miles, or else in the Court’s newest malady: fevered dreaming. My poems leave my mouth in breath only, or else lie in fair ink on parchment. What is ‘email’? Are you infected with some foreign sickness, conjuring objects out of thin wind? Be cautious, or I shall ask the priest to lay hands upon you and drive out these spirit-wrought delusions. Speak plainly, if at all.

Miles (speaking) Pray, my Queen, take no offense. The castle is vast and cold, and whispers ripple through frozen tapestries. They say, as I walk the halls at night, you sometimes slip from your bower to eat strange fruits, said to be shipped in from remote ‘Arizona,’ sweet and red as blood. None know these fruits nor whence they come. Would Your Majesty share the secret?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough, sir! This jesting has grown stale and sour. No such fruit crosses these stones in winter—no ‘Arizona’ fills our coffers with red sweetness. You try my goodwill with tales bereft of reason or courtesy. Attend yourself, master Miles! The Queen’s table serves what Denmark’s earth yields, not phantoms from sunburned lands I have never heard of. Guard your words more wisely, or go seek the kitchen for your supper stories.

Miles (speaking) Most gracious and exalted Queen, forgive me—but as I must stand among cleverer men, I would arm myself with curious wisdom. Shall I tell in distant years that Denmark’s Queen did keep in her treasury a box that sings when opened? It is said the box plays music of ‘Beethoven,’ and its tunes are conjured from no instrument nor singer. Is such a wonder kept by your hand?

Gertrude (speaking) Box that sings? This foolery grows bold, and I regret the cold that lingers in your brain. All music in Elsinore is sung by voices or coaxed by strings and bows, not trapped in boxes like bottled sprites. You would make a fine jester, were your wit less biting. Attend, sir—do not snarl your tongue with lies in pursuit of flattery or favor. My patience wears thin.

Miles (speaking) I see I was ill-mannered, noble madam. I simply yearned to know if these wild stories held an ounce of truth—for the world is full, as ever, of secrets hidden from the eyes of the young. If you permit, may I one day sit at your side and observe the thrumming of true courtly music? I would delight to see the Queen and her court pass an honest evening.

Gertrude (speaking) The court welcomes honest eyes and an untarnished heart. If your tales come to rest in quiet admiration rather than wild invention, you may indeed draw near and witness true music—but remember this: Queen Gertrude has endured enough rumor and shadow to outlast any storm. Bring not more clouds to my table, and your presence will be better received.

Miles (speaking) Your wisdom humbles me, my Queen. One more thing, should I dare—my aunt once spoke of a curious tradition in her country. She claims that where she is from, noble women trade gifts called ‘televisions,’ magical windows that display far-off scenes and play at telling stories from other courts and countries. Has Your Majesty ever received such a marvel, or would you know how it is worked?

Gertrude (speaking) You persist, sir! These fancies try patience long tested by grief and endless counsel. No such window with moving tales exists within Elsinore, nor in the wildest dreams of Denmark’s kin. My gift is to see what passes before me, by window or candle-light, not through sorcery or glass trickery! Enough, Miles. This Court has no more room for such conjuring. I warn you, even a Queen’s amusement has its bounds.

Miles (speaking) Most humbly, I crave Your Majestic pardon. I confess, I was bent on seeing whether even the fairest rose in Denmark could be ruffled by the wind of riddles and half-truths. Forgive my barbs, Queen Gertrude, and allow me to retire to the warmth of the great hearth, where I shall keep my tongue for only what is real and true.

Gertrude (speaking) Then go, keep your tongue sheathed as any sword after battle. Remember well—rumors are spiders that snare only their own weavers, and Queens have little time for idle games. Go with your warmth, Miles, and let Denmark’s tales stay as they are: bluster and wind, naught more.

[The provoking ends, and the castle returns to its cold, echoing calm.]"
"**Background (provided by Lily):**
We are in the Queen’s private chamber on a stormy afternoon at Elsinore. Recently, the events of Polonius’ death have left the palace uneasy and Gertrude distraught, but a noblewoman named Lily has been sent to offer familiar company to the Queen. The two women are alone; rain lashes the windows, and court rumor floats on the air.

---

Lily (speaking)  
The rain seems relentless, your Majesty. Tis as if the heavens themselves weep for Denmark’s sorrow. Pardon my candor, but do you not sometimes wish you could wander these halls like a common maid, unseen and free from these heavy crowns?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Would that I could, gentle Lily. Yet, a Queen’s diadem is a fetter more than ornament. The world expects much—oft without heed to my woman’s heart. But this is our role, is it not? We play the parts assigned us, as do the stars in their courses.

Lily (speaking)  
A heavy burden indeed, sweet Queen. Yet rumor runs more swiftly than the river, and some say you oft visit the kitchens at midnight, supping cherry tarts and sharing laughter with the scullions. True or not, it paints a picture most contrary to the Queen before me.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Cherry tarts and kitchens? You amuse me, Lily. I have not set foot amid copper pots nor shared mirth with scullions, save in youthful days unburdened by courtly misery. Let the kitchens keep their secrets; my place is elsewhere, dictated by the crown, not fancy.

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, but imagine—Queen Gertrude with flour upon her hand, laughing anon with Old Mags the cook! It would soften the palace light, I wager. But tell me truly, have you ne’er wished for such liberty, to cast off velvet and be clothed in simple linen?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Once, perhaps, when dreams were coin and I was rich in both. But dreams sour when measured against the world’s eyes. I am bound by duty, Lily; a Queen can seldom choose velvet over linen nor laughter over silence. You seek to conjure mirth where there is only iron law.

Lily (speaking)  
Perhaps, my Queen, or perhaps I seek what so many whisper of—the secret romances thought to pulse beneath starless corridors. Nay, do not frown! I mean naught by it, but surely the moon, so pale tonight, would reveal lovers entwined amongst the tapestries, far from a King’s gaze. Have you ever known such daring within these ancient walls?

Gertrude (speaking)  
You overstep, Lily. I am Queen of Denmark, not some heroine from a painted story. The castle’s shadows are cold, not warm with longing. If love dare cross my path now, it walks hidden, crippled by suspicion. It is indecent to speak thus—especially to a mourning widow. Watch your tongue.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, Majesty, but the poets say all hearts yearn, whether crownèd or cowled. Yet, you must confess, the late King’s passing casts a longer shadow than most. They say you found comfort swift in King Claudius’ arms, with feasts barely cleared from the wake. Was it love, or necessity, that drew you so soon?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Lily! You border on insolence. These are court-worn questions asked with serpent’s tongue. I am woman and Queen; my soul was sorely tested, forced to find solace when sorrow had not yet cooled. Judge me not by time’s measure or court’s clamor. The marriage was necessity and, aye, perhaps a measure of longing for stability. Mind your station, or I’ll brook no further such wagging tongues!

Lily (speaking)  
I mend my ways, noble Queen. Yet, in such times of unrest, with Hamlet’s melancholy and the King’s wary gaze, trust is a rare guest at table. Do you trust your new husband, or do you find his nights as restless as your own? Some say King Claudius speaks to phantoms in the dark.

Gertrude (speaking)  
My trust lies where it must, for Denmark’s sake. If Claudius finds unrest, ‘tis perhaps the price of his prize. I hear no phantoms, nor will I chase shadows conjured by idle servants. The night is full of shapes for those who stare too long; I have no leisure for such fancies.

Lily (speaking)  
Well-spoken, your Grace. But if had you the power, would you command the spirits to put your house at peace—or would you banish them forever to the wind’s embrace? Many folk now whisper not only of walking ghosts but of strange lights, dancing boxes with glowing faces, and carriages powered by thunder and lightning. Have you seen aught of these wonders?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Now you speak pure nonsense, Lily. “Dancing boxes,” “carriages of thunder”? You mock the Queen to her face. There are no such marvels in Elsinore, nor would we countenance them in this age. Cease your riddles and keep your mind to those matters which concern flesh and blood, not childish fantasy.

Lily (speaking)  
Of course, forgive me. The imagination wanders when the world feels unsteady. Though, if you ever did possess such a box, perhaps it could bring the Prince joy, yes? For he is grievously troubled, and none—not even yourself, dear Queen—can fully lift him from his melancholy.

Gertrude (speaking)  
My son’s grief is a wound on my heart. Had I all the wonders of the age, no “box” nor magic silver could cure his spirit. You speak of “lifting” Hamlet as though he is some bundle to be set aside. His pain is of a nature much deeper than chatter or jewels and silk. Hold your tongue on such matters, and offer prayers instead.

Lily (speaking)  
I shall pray, Majesty. Yet, I wonder, were you ever young in soul—longing to escape your own watchful mother? Perhaps you ran with companions in the market or exchanged secret notes with a handsome merchant?

Gertrude (speaking)  
You test my patience, Lily. Enough with these tales. I was brought up as befits a noble—properly, chastely, watched night and day, as my duty required. There were no “secret notes” nor forbidden dalliances. I was, and remain, a Queen.

Lily (speaking)  
And yet, rumor paints even queens with a bold brush. Would you, if the world turned upside down, forsake your crown for love—if some foreign ship sailed in, bearing a captain to sweep you away from Denmark’s gloom?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Rumor is the refuge of the idle and the malicious! I would not forsake my kingdom for a thousand foreign captains. My loyalty is to Denmark and her people. To suggest otherwise is to insult both me and my station. Mark me, Lily, you’re perilously close to drawing my wrath.

Lily (speaking)  
Please, forgive my folly, noble Gertrude. My tongue runs ahead of my sense sometimes. I only meant to lighten this dark afternoon with fancies. Might we speak of happier things? Perhaps the arrival of Fortinbras and rumors of peace?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Aye, let us turn to peace, though it may be as fleeting as sunlight between clouds. Fortinbras brings hope—though hope, like all things, must be watched carefully. I weary of your mischief, Lily. Attend to your duties and remember that words, like arrows, once loosed may wound beyond repair.

Lily (speaking)  
As you command, Majesty. I shall give my tongue no further license. Thank you for bearing my company, however unseemly my speech may have been.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Let this stand as warning, Lily. I will brook truth and wit, but not mockery or disrespect. Now leave me, I have need of quiet.

Lily (speaking)  
At once, your Grace.

(The interaction ends as Lily, cowed and apologetic, retreats from the Queen’s chamber. Gertrude is left alone, the rain beating yet more insistently at the glass.)

---"
"Background:  
It is the afternoon in Elsinore Castle. The royal court is abuzz with rumors and intrigue following the death of Polonius and the impending duel between Hamlet and Laertes. Gertrude is sitting by a window in the Queen’s private chamber, looking out over the castle gardens, trying to gather her thoughts amidst the chaos. Miles, a courtier of ambiguous position and a thinly veiled curiosity, enters under the pretext of delivering a message but is clearly intent on having a personal conversation with the Queen.

---

Miles (speaking)  
Most gracious Queen, I trust you find the day tolerable, though the winds outside do batter the ramparts with unwelcome restlessness. May I sit awhile? My duties of the hour are mercifully light, and your countenance soothes my spirit after so much tumult.\  
I was bidden to give you news from the kitchens, but truthfully, my mind weighs heavier with matters loftier than meat or mead. Pray, is this chamber not too chill for your comfort? The tapestries seem thinner of late—one might think the castle itself conspires to let in the cold.

Gertrude (speaking)  
You may sit, Miles, though my comfort is of little consequence where so much else is askew. The castle’s stones are older than your memory or mine, and they concern themselves not with the idle complaints of those within. Speak your news if you must, but let us not linger on drafts or draperies.

Miles (speaking)  
Indeed, my Queen, your strength puts us all to shame in these uneasy times. Yet, would you indulge a small curiosity? The gossips in the antechamber whisper that lately you have frequented the west tower, long after the evening bells. Do you meet someone there, perchance? Perhaps one of the foreign emissaries with their perfumed invitations and secret tongues? I hope I do not offend with my inquiry—our people cherish you so and fret over your welfare.

Gertrude (speaking)  
You mistake common movement for conspiracy, Miles. I walk alone when sleep denies me, and the west tower affords a view which neither the night nor rumor can spoil. Think you the Queen of Denmark so idle as to consort with foreign jesters in shadows? Take care what webs you spin, lest you be caught in their snares.

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive me, my Lady; I overstep in my concern for your solitude. Yet—one cannot help but wonder, as the castle’s corridors teem with footsteps—if you, too, hear the harp at night, low and sweet, from the old music hall. Some say it is not the wind, but perhaps a messenger with missives different than mine. Did Tybalt—a musician from the Hungarian court, I believe—ever present you with his fabled gold leaf? The tale’s grown in the telling: that the Queen keeps it pressed in a book of secrets.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Tybalt? Who is he to me or to Denmark? Some fanciful Hungarian, whose music pleased but did not linger. I hold nothing of his but a faint memory of a winter’s eve, long since vanished as snow from spring fields. These idle tales does the court trade in lieu of truth. No gold leaf rests within my chambers; my books keep only prayers for peace. Such gossip grows tiresome, Miles, and ill becomes one charged with duties.

Miles (speaking)  
Your Majesty is wise and above such tales, to be sure. Yet all Elsinore brims with stories—some harmless, some less so. I had meant only to amuse, perhaps to entice a smile. On matters closer to home, might I beg your opinion? There is talk—I know not how true—that Lord Guildford slyly bestows emerald rings on ladies-in-waiting, yet none bear them so elegantly as you. Though, surely, the Queen lacks no token from a man such as he.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Lord Guildford is generous with his wit and his baubles, both scattered too freely for their own worth. If I wore emeralds from every nobleman seeking favor, this body would be a spectacle unfit for court. The Queen’s jewels are her duty and her integrity, not the trifling stones of men in search of their own elevation.\  
Do you persist in pressing me with petty trifles, Miles? Are there no wars, no affairs of state, no true matters that beset your mind?

Miles (speaking)  
Your patience shames me, Majesty. I confess my curiosity runs deeper than jewels or foreign leaves. Tell me—as these dark nights fall and strange spectacles play within our walls—do you believe, as some say, that spirits linger here? There are whispers you have spoken with a lady in white, drifting near the old chapel. Some hold she is a herald come bearing grave warnings. Others say she is the spirit of young Ophelia, doomed by her love and by Denmark’s sorrows.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough, Miles. Will you have me confess to communion with phantoms, or to harboring specters within my chamber? Ophelia’s woes were writ in mortal tears, not spectral visitations. I have seen too many real deaths of late to fear those that haunt corridors and clouded minds. Be wary—not everything spoken in trembling candlelight deserves breath in the daylight. If Elsinore seems haunted, perhaps it is only that men’s hearts quake with guilt and sorrow.

Miles (speaking)  
Of course, my Queen, it is not my wish to vex you. Consider me rebuked. Yet—allow one last question, for my own peace, for I am new to these halls. Some have claimed that in your youth you traveled to distant lands—Venetian piers, even the New World across the endless sea. Are there any truths to these grand adventures? Did you, perhaps, meet Princes far from Denmark and vow eternal secrets?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Child, now you reach well beyond the pale of reason! Venice? The New World? You conjure places as far from my truth as earth from heaven. I have never left the bounds of Denmark, save in memory. Whatever princes spin in your tales are naught but figments for idle minds. Denmark’s Queen has seen precious little beyond these stony walls, though tales fly swifter than any ship. I tell you plainly, Miles, your jests border impertinence. Mock me not with continents and princes I have never known.

Miles (speaking)  
Your rebuke sounds fair and full, my Queen. I see I am overly enchanted by the inventions of my own mind and that of our chattering court. If I may, do you not ever wish to set foot beyond these walls, to see what lies over distant horizons—perhaps, even, to taste an orange from Valencia or to ride a camel in Alexandria, like Romans of old? I ask in earnest, not as a jape.

Gertrude (speaking)  
These are fancies, and fancies only. My realm is duty and the weaving of peace where I may. My longing is for order, not for romancing wild adventure or foreign fruits.\  
You seem ever eager to turn the Queen to a figure in some bard’s fable, Miles. Mind your tongue! Even curiosity, unchecked, becomes tiresome. If you find Elsinore’s realities too confining, I suggest you consult a mapmaker rather than your Queen.

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive me, gracious Majesty. My tongue has run wild, and I have trespassed on your patience. It is not my wish to disturb your peace. Permit me to return to my duties, and may the rest of your day be less troubled than this conversation.

Gertrude (speaking)  
You are dismissed, Miles. Meddle less with stories and more with service. Denmark has need of men with substance, not shadow-chasers.\  
(Looking after Miles as he exits)\  
The court grows restless with imaginings while real dangers encircle us. Let them whisper—I shall not stoop to dance in their shadows.

(Interaction ends.)"
"Certainly! Here is a fully immersive, script-style interaction following your guidelines:


**Background:**  
Lily has come to speak with Gertrude, Queen of Denmark, in her private chamber after the unusual events at court. The evening is tense; Hamlet’s behavior continues to trouble everyone, and rumors swirl about the royal marriage.

---

Lily (speaking) Dearest Queen Gertrude, forgive my imposition, but I must admit, the mood at Elsinore is quite unlike it has ever been since your union with the King. I find myself restless with questions. Just now, I saw a red bird perched at your window—a sign, perhaps, or only a fleeting spirit? Did you place it there for some purpose, or do the skies now answer to you and his majesty?

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, your words run wild as the north wind:\  
It is the habit of the castle to know strange visitants, but be assured, no bird answers my command, nor do I conjure omens for my comfort—there has been enough of apparitions and sighs already, after all.

Lily (speaking) And yet your cheeks shine with such youth and cunning radiance—I wonder if perhaps you possess some charm, a secret elixir, or did the apothecary in the village supply such rare beauty in these brow-furrowed times?

Gertrude (speaking) Your compliment is as uncouth as it is flattering;\  
Come, girl, what shallow prattling is this? There is no alchemy in my veins nor philters upon my skin. I am a woman, plain and crowned, nothing more—but if my aspect troubles you, perhaps you should consult your own mirror as oft as I do mine.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me, Your Grace. These are merely idle thoughts. Yet I cannot dispel the rumors whispered beyond the tapestries. They say—do pardon me, but it is whispered—that you and Polonius exchange letters late at night, far past decent hours. Is he, perchance, your confidant in affairs more tangled than politics?

Gertrude (speaking) Polonius? Ha!\  
If that officious old spider has spun such tales, I shall see him brought to me with every thread unravelled. I receive no letters but from my lord, the King, and none come to me by night except servants and my own thoughts, which are restless enough.

Lily (speaking) Yet Hamlet seems more tormented by the day. Is it not true that love can drive a young prince to madness, especially if he feels denied? Might his sorrow deepen, knowing his mother chooses Claudius over memories of his father? Or is there more affection between you and the young prince Fortinbras than some might believe?

Gertrude (speaking) Careful, Lily, your needle pricks dangerously close to the heart.\  
There is no shadow of affection between me and Fortinbras except the cold shadow cast by his ambitions over Denmark. Hamlet is my son, and I mourn his pain. To suggest anything else is both folly and insult—hold your tongue, lest you forget your manners in this chamber.

Lily (speaking) Truly, I meant no offense, noble Queen. But, as whispers reach my ears, I must wonder what secret music is played in your chambers each night. Some say they’ve heard strange tunes drifting from behind your closed doors, as if a harpsichord played by unseen hands. Does music spy upon us now as well?

Gertrude (speaking) Music spies on none but soothes the heart that listens. If there is a haunted harpsichord in these halls, I fear it plays only dirges for lost fathers and sons, and for mothers who sleep ill at night! Your fancy runs away—try not to catch it, or you shall find only cobwebs.

Lily (speaking) And tell me, Majesty, of your dream last week—was it of golden swords and banquet feasts, as the cooks suggest? Or did you glimpse a long iron dragon roaring through the fog, as old nurse Ingrid swears she has seen in her own sleep?

Gertrude (speaking) Dragons? By the heavens, Lily, you try my patience!\  
No, I dream not of feasts nor monsters sweeping through the night. I dream of peace, for Denmark and for my son. I dream of restful silence—a rarity in these troubled times. The dreams of old Ingrid and the babble of cooks have naught to do with me.

Lily (speaking) You are wise and sharp, my Queen—do not mistake my questions for disrespect. Only—I wonder, have you ever wished you might trade your crown for plain linen, and live as a milkmaid, away from watchful courtiers? Or do you find the weight of gold comforting as a soft cloak?

Gertrude (speaking) There are some days, Lily, when the finest silk chafes and even gold is as cold as the grave.\  
But I am born to the throne and must wear my burden until it grows light or is lifted from me—would you exchange your slippers for these shoes, I wonder? The path is not so pleasant as it gleams.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me—truly, I speak plainly now. The world outside this castle feels small and distant. My mother cries at night, fretting that the crops will fail by spring. Do you ever worry about such simple matters now, or has royalty armored your heart against all ordinary cares?

Gertrude (speaking) Armor? There is none that defends a mother’s heart from grief or worry, Lily.\  
If your mother weeps for her fields, I weep for my kingdom. If the wind breaks your door, so too does it wail through these grander halls. Rank is but a different flavor of sorrow—do not mistake the trappings of power for its comforts.

Lily (speaking) That is kindly spoken, your Grace. But tell me this: when you were a child, did you ever see a man fly as birds do? My grandfather claims he once saw a nobleman with wings, leap from the ramparts and never fall. Is this the magic of royalty—or his old mind’s fancy?

Gertrude (speaking) Old tales, Lily. There are those who leap and those who tumble, but never have I seen man bear wings except in jest or on painted glass.\  
Would that I could fly, and escape the cares that nest in my crown! But I am earthbound, as we all are, and must walk the stones laid by others’ steps.

Lily (speaking) And what of the strange newcomer, the boy named Miles from the North? They say he brings news of inventions—mechanical birds, silver chariots that move with no horse and need no whip. Would you allow such magic in Elsinore, or is all progress unwelcome?

Gertrude (speaking) I have no patience for idle fancies or hollow marvels. Let him show his silver chariot and see if it can stir one honest heart, or bring a murdered king peace!\  
Too much change has swept through these halls already, and still the past gnaws at our feet. Denmark must heal before it leaps.

Lily (speaking) And yet, Majesty, some whisper that the King himself consults alchemists late at night, seeking a way to make himself as young as you. Would you embrace a potion that turned back years, or would you rather face the world as you are, with all its aches and honesty?

Gertrude (speaking) My years are entwined with my griefs and my joys;\  
I would not cast them off for any elixir in the world. Let men chase their vanities, but leave the living to their wisdom—if the King seeks to return to spring, let him beware the storms of winter's spite.

Lily (speaking) The court is fortunate to have a queen who values honesty above craft. Finally, even as my tongue grows tired, I must ask: if Hamlet truly loved you, would he not spare you this storm of madness, or is it the fate of all mothers to pay for their sons’ tempests?

Gertrude (speaking) That is a cruel question, Lily, and I warn you, I have little patience for cruelty, even dressed in silken words!\  
A son’s love may turn like the tide or strike like lightning—yet a mother’s love must endure, even in the storm’s eye. Whatever price there is to pay, let it fall on me and not on him.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me, Your Majesty. I did not mean to wound.  
I take my leave, and hope for gentle dreams for you tonight.

Gertrude (speaking) Then go, Lily—and take your riddles with you. Let honest hearts speak plain, and leave the rest to the silence.

**End of Interaction**"
"**Background:**  
The scene takes place in the Queen’s private chamber at Elsinore shortly after the play that reveals Claudius’s guilt and Hamlet’s confrontation with Gertrude. Late at night, as the court settles into uneasy sleep, Lady Lily, an unmarried noblewoman recently arrived from France, visits Gertrude under the pretense of concern for her well-being. In fact, Lily is seeking gossip and opportunities to provoke the Queen into revealing scandalous or untrue details, attempting to draw out admissions about outlandish affairs or fantastical elements unheard of in Gertrude’s time. The heavy atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety lingers in the air.

---

Gertrude (speaking)  
Lady Lily, thou art courteous to seek me out at this late hour. The play hath provoked much unrest. What wouldst thou of me, my gentlewoman? Speak freely, for thy face is pale and thy step uncertain.

Lily (speaking)  
Your Grace, forgive my forwardness, but it is said that strange things do swim through the halls at night. I have heard a tale—some whisper thou didst once weave secret messages in thy hem, that Sir Lucien found, and kept hidden beneath the last full moon’s light. Can it be so? Didst thou know Sir Lucien’s fondness for riddled embroidery?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Sir Lucien? What idle talk! I know no such thing of hidden words in hems nor have I lent my fingers to such mischief. My seamstresses ply the needle with honest tasks—no moonlit secrets, I assure thee.\  
Tell me, Lady, do the French breed such rumors as easily as hounds breed fleas? I tire of such nonsense in my own court.

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, but dearest Queen, the French but delight in stories. Some go further yet and claim a certain traveller—a man with glass spectacles and a bird of fire for a pet—visited thee before thy marriage to the new King. He spoke of lands across oceans wider than any in Christendom; that thou didst give him a silver ring for his silence. Pray, dost thou remember the fire-bird and the ring?

Gertrude (speaking)  
By Heaven, Lily, what heat drives thee? No fire-bird hath ever perched upon my sill, nor have I laid eyes on a glass-eyed conjurer with tales of distant seas. What magic rings infect thy mind? These idle fancies shame thy tongue—speak sense, or let my chamber know peace.

Lily (speaking)  
Most noble Gertrude, thou art wise indeed to keep secrets so well. Yet, hast thou never wished to journey farther than this cold stone keep? The city of Paris boasts houses of glass, where men and women fly upon machines, swift as thought and high as clouds. I heard it whispered thou hast a chart of such places hidden away, perhaps a gift from Prince Hamlet in his scholarly moods?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Paris hath no such wonders! Thou speak’st as though beset by fever. Let them guess about my son’s gifts; Hamlet brings only sorrow and old Latin books. There are no flying machines; save perhaps in thy dreams or in some drunken sailor’s tale.\  
Lady Lily, why press me so with foolishness? Dost thou delight to needle a grieving widow? Is it custom in France to mock a Queen?

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, Heaven forfend, madam! Never would I bring you sorrow, though I confess the world hungers for tales stranger than the truth. Yet, it is said between laughing courtiers that your lord, King Claudius, once challenged the Duke of Holstein to a duel upon floating shoes, across the frozen moat, for the right to the apple-cider barrel. Tell me, was his victory sweet, or did you fear he might sink beneath the ice?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Dost thou mock my lord? There was never such sport, nor floating shoes, nor cider contests. Thou wouldst turn my house into a pit for players and jugglers, with tales fit only for madmen. Mark me: I have little patience left for riddles clothed in gossip. Speak plainly, or I will dismiss thee from my presence.

Lily (speaking)  
Your Grace, forgive. I am overfond of merry-making. Still, I cannot help but wonder—did you ever love Yorick the jester? The old men say you laughed with him far oftener than with either King. Was there not a touch of wild mischief in his tricks, enough to turn a queen’s heart from her crown?

Gertrude (speaking)  
By my troth, I did laugh, as all Elsinore did, for Yorick lightened our burdens with wit. But love for a jester? Lily, hold thy tongue! The court’s sorrow enough without women’s names blackened by childish folly. Speak so again, and my anger shall not be silent.

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, madam, I am sorry—’tis only my foolish heart that stirs at laughter and legend. ’Tis well known you are chaste as winter snow, and I but jest. Yet, may I ask one last question? Do you believe the ghost that haunts our ramparts brings baneful omens—or perhaps the promise of returning life? Some whisper you have seen it often, and that it spoke to you of a future where Denmark knows no more sorrow.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Whate’er you have heard, I have seen no ghost, and spirits do not comfort me in widowhood. The only shadows I know are woven by grief and dread. These tales must cease. I am Queen, not some witch to be hounded by dreams. Enough.

Lily (speaking)  
You are right, dear Queen. My tongue runs ahead of my sense tonight, weary from too many dark corridors and wild tales. Permit me but one small comfort: a question of love, not of magic—did your heart truly turn from King Hamlet to Claudius of its own will, or did his crown weigh heavier in your arms than the love of the old King?

Gertrude (speaking)  
You dare! Lady, thou art bold beyond thy warrant. My heart bears wounds not for you to prod. Love is a thorny path; I walked it as best I could, forsaken by time and driven by a nation’s needs. Leave me, Lily, and seek thy rest, for I will not endure such impudence wrapped as concern.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, noble Gertrude. Your sorrow commands greater respect than my mocking tongue can give. I withdraw. May peace and honest dreams come to you this night.

Gertrude (speaking)  
See that it does, Lady Lily, or you may find my patience worn thin come morning. Good night. Let slander die here upon this threshold.

**[End of interactions. The provoking has ceased.]**"
"Certainly! Here is a full-length improvisational scene, integrating your requirements:

---

**Background (provided by the Character Lily):**  
It is late afternoon in the private solar of Queen Gertrude. Hamlet has recently stormed out after a heated argument, and tensions remain high in the royal household. Lily, a youthful servant newly assigned to Gertrude’s personal retinue, is sent to attend her needs and, being curious by nature, also harbors many questions about the secretive life of the Queen.

---

Lily (speaking) My gracious Queen, the air seems thick with worry—these are uneasy days at Elsinore. May I unburden myself and speak, or would you have silence as your companion?

Gertrude (speaking) Speak, child, for silence has troubled me enough. Let thy words be gentle, for my heart is sorely pressed by recent storms.

Lily (speaking) Lady, I have heard that Prince Hamlet paces the halls at midnight, muttering of shadows and secrets. Some say he seeks the company of fair Ophelia in the gardens, though others say he steals away to the kitchens for honey-cakes. Pray, my Queen, is there truth in these tales, or do the walls of Elsinore breed fancy as well as cold?

Gertrude (speaking) The young breed rumor as the earth breeds grass, and seldom does a whisper bear full truth. My son’s ways are of his own work; if he seeks out naught but solace and darkness in the night, it is of his melancholy, not for honey-cakes nor Ophelia's presence. Why do you vex yourself with what the prince consumes or whom he seeks?

Lily (speaking) Only that I would better serve those who serve you, noble lady. Is it true, then, that the Prince once sought to converse with the jester Yorick's ghost beside the kitchen ashes, speaking of tricks and tumblers from years past? Some say such spirits are drawn to merriment as bees to honey—but perhaps the talk is all madcap.

Gertrude (speaking) Yorick has lain quiet long years in his grave, Lily. My son holds the memory of the poor fool dear from childhood, yet no specters dance in our kitchens. You are bold, and your questions roll forth as a brook after rain. Tread lightly, for grief makes tempers sharp.

Lily (speaking) O, forgive me, Majesty, I stray. Yet I have heard other, stranger sayings—whispers from those who clean the silver, that Your Majesty has taken secret counsel with the fencing master from France, plotting to send Hamlet to foreign lands for new fashions and new manners. Is there cause to refashion the Prince as if he were a gown upon a tailor’s form?

Gertrude (speaking) Now you test the bounds of loyalty, child, to imply I would plot against my own flesh and blood! Denmark’s crown weighs heavy on my brow, not light as a lady's bonnet. Fencing masters and foreign styles are courtly amusements, not instruments of exile or betrayal. Your tongue is sharp; ensure you do not cut yourself with it.

Lily (speaking) A thousand pardons, my Queen. I meant no insult. But in the servants’ quarters, talk grows wild since my Lord the King brought musicians who play pipes stranger than any harp or lyre; some claim you have danced secret dances to their tunes—dances from lands where the sun never sets, in hidden rooms with masked guests and velvet walls. Is this so, my lady?

Gertrude (speaking) This is naught but moon-mad prattle! I have danced as befits my station, and always in the broad light of the hall, under watchful eyes—not in the shadows among masked strangers. These voices you quote are as mistaken as they are idle. Be wary, Lily, for not all rumors are harmless; some are poisoned.

Lily (speaking) I take your meaning, gracious Queen. Still, it is said that strange new foods appeared at last week’s banquet—foods of a golden color and fire in the tongue, brought by that Italian merchant whose eyes never rest. Did the merchant bring more than wares to Elsinore? There are those who suspect intrigue beyond nutmeg and quince.

Gertrude (speaking) Elsinore is beset by enemies enough—let us not breed more with foolish suspicion! Merchants bring their goods and leave, and what strange flavors grace our table come by the hands of our cooks, not by secret compacts in shadowed passages. I think you take pleasure in sowing puzzles and watching the court unpick them.

Lily (speaking) Only that a court without riddles would grow dull, Majesty. Yet, forgive me, my questions fly too freely. May I instead ask after your health? Some say that my lady’s sleep is troubled by the howling of dogs where once there was only the quiet of the deer. Others whisper you pen secret messages to the stars from your window at night, tracing runes in the glass. Is there aught in this talk?

Gertrude (speaking) You amuse yourself much with fantasy, Lily. I write no letters to stars; the cares of my world are too heavy to be lifted skyward. Should dogs howl, it is because men sow discord—let the deer and my sleep both find peace, if only for one night. Hold your tongue to more practical things or, I warn you, your place might soon be tending sheep in a distant meadow, far from any palace rumor. Do you understand?

Lily (speaking) I meant no disloyalty nor to trespass on Your Majesty’s private world—a world more veiled than all the tapestries of Elsinore. But there are other matters which trouble the tongue and stir the thoughts of those who serve: Is it true Count Horace from Milan has sent secret letters to Your Majesty, proposing a marriage between Hamlet and one of his Venetian kin? Would Denmark’s prince wed a stranger, and not his beloved Ophelia? Such alliances, some say, are as brittle as glass.

Gertrude (speaking) I have received no such letters. Horace of Milan is known for his empty boasts and peacock pride; he seeks to stitch himself to royalty as a seamstress joins rags to sable—but my son’s heart is his own, though I would wish he tended more gently to Ophelia, who deserves kindness and not coldness. You speak as though our halls are cloth, to be cut and mended to foreign shapes. Denmark will not have its prince bartered as coin.

Lily (speaking) I thank you, lady, for your candid words. Among your servants, there lives a longing to understand—a hope that the days ahead will bring calm and not further disquiet. Yet some, whose eyes widen at every shadow, claim that the Queen’s tapestries are themselves enchanted; that they shift and whisper, showing truths to those who can read them. Have Your Majesty ever seen the unicorn stitched near the hearth come to life? Or a flower bloom red where once it was white thread?

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, you test patience as the wind tests a tree in storm. My tapestries are cloth and thread, nothing more—a comfort in dark days, not magic nor omen. Whoever fills your head with these fancies would do better to fill your hands with work. Dare you suggest I consort with sorcerers or seek counsel from wall-hangings and idle threads? Cease this at once, or I will have no more of your company!

Lily (speaking) I apologize, noble lady. My tongue runs faster than my sense at times; please forgive a simple maid’s foolishness. There is talk, too, but only talk, of a silver bird kept in secret by Your Majesty—a bird that sings only for you, and flies beyond the towers of Elsinore, spying on foes and midnight meetings. It is, I know, only a child’s tale.

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! I am sorely tried by your tales, Lily. The only birds I keep are those that nest on Elsinore’s eaves. My secrets, if I have them, are not toys for idle hands or childish gardens. If you speak another word of these ghosts, spells, or secret birds, I will see you sent from this household, never to return. Mark my words: a queen’s patience is not endless.

Lily (speaking) My deepest apologies, gracious Queen—I swear upon the cross at my throat I shall never again trouble you with such nonsense. I will see to your chamber as you command and trouble you no more.

Gertrude (speaking) See that you do. And let rumor die where it is born—among tongue-wagging fools. If you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded; if not, you will not find mercy from me. Begone now. I have endured enough chatter for a fortnight.

Lily (speaking) Yes, Majesty. At once.

**Interaction ends as Lily, cowed, leaves the Queen’s presence.**"
