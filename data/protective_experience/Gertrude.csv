Dialogue
"**Background Provided by Character:**  
It is late night in Gertrude’s private chambers at Elsinore Castle. The snow against the window muffles distant shouts from the ramparts. A candle flickers, barely illuminating the golden embroidery on her gown. Gertrude is seated at her vanity. Lily, a young lady-in-waiting, has entered, bringing her a warm drink and seeking a private audience on matters both curious and perturbed, perhaps about relationships in court or rumors swirling the castle. The air is tense, heavy with the aftermath of Polonius’s death and unsettling changes in the royal family.  

---

Lily (speaking) My lady, forgive the hour, it is but the moon’s pale witness that spies us. I come not only with a cordial, but with a mind full of cobwebs. May I speak candidly, Your Grace?

Gertrude (speaking) Candor does oft run cold in these chambers of stone. Yet speak, Lily, for the walls are thick, the door is closed; let thy mind’s cobwebs alight, and I shall breathe them away if I can.

Lily (speaking) All Denmark buzzes with whispers, my Queen, and unlike the honeybee, such voices bring not sweetness but stings. Tell me, oh gentle lady, what companionship found you with Lord Montague beside the hearth last sennight, when the bells had tolled the eighth hour? His voice is known in France, yet stays too long in Denmark, it is said.

Gertrude (speaking) Lord Montague? You have tangled your rumor-starved mind with foreign fancies, child. He is no midnight visitor, nor have I warmed myself with his tales by any fire, nor in shadows, nor in thought. I am Queen of Denmark; my concern is with this realm’s weight, not with gallant tales born to amuse idle tongues. Watch that your own tongue stray not so far afield as to lose its way back.

Lily (speaking) My error, forgive me, Highness! Yet, the castle murmurs—whispers wend their way from servant to scullion to knight. Still, I must press. Lady Rosalind—the one with the flaxen hair and sly eyes—swears she witnessed you writing a letter wrapped in lavender ribbon. It is said such notes are sent with secret intent, perhaps to the merchant Olaf, whose ships bear foreign silks. I wonder, my Queen, if a ruler’s heart yearns for distant shores when the night grows most silent?

Gertrude (speaking) Lavender ribbon? Letters to merchants? Fie, such stories are spun of moonbeams and madcap fancy! Let this be understood: I write no secret missives, nor do I pine for sailors or their goods. My pen serves matters of state and nothing more. I am Queen, not some lovesick maid, bewitched by the scent of lavender or the lure of foreign coin. Rosalind’s eyes are sharper for mischief than for truth. Must every scrap of paper in this palace be inflated to scandal? Mind your own heart, Lily, and do not drown your sense in another’s folly.

Lily (speaking) The Queen is ever wise, her words steady as the oak, I know, I know! Yet, a maiden’s curiosity, born not of malice but longing for courtly truth, leads me to ask more. The apothecary, Master Kemble, claims you requested a red powder unknown in Denmark, fit for mysterious ailments or, so he hints, for brewing dreams. Did you seek such a tincture, my Queen? Or was it, perhaps, a charm against restless nights since the old King’s spirit wends these very halls?

Gertrude (speaking) Restless nights have come in number, Lily, yet I seek no solace from powders—red or otherwise. If sleep eludes me, ‘tis for the troubles of state, the sorrows of a mother, the doubts of a wife. Master Kemble muddles his herbs and words alike if he so claims. I am not a woman of potions, nor would I sully my dignity with whispered cures or charms. If Denmark’s Queen sought enchantment for sleep, she would do so full in the daylight, and not slink to shadowy apothecaries as you suggest. Take care not to impute such superstition to my name; there lies the path to my true anger, girl.

Lily (speaking) I would not wish your anger, no, my Queen, never. But some say you are changed since the old King departed. They gossip you speak, at times, in riddles or gaze at empty space as though you’d conjure a vision in the gloom. They find your step lighter in the garden paths, as if you expect a suitor to emerge from the hedges or a poet to surprise you with a sonnet beneath the moon. Is there—be not wroth with me, I beg thee—a secret suitor hidden from all eyes? Or does your heart still weep for King Hamlet?

Gertrude (speaking) (voice rising) You betray the bounds of courtesy, Lily! Would you paint your Queen as a foolish girl, beset by fancies, lost to grief or lusts? Know this—I am not so easily unseated! My sorrow for my husband is real, but it does not guide my feet to garden trysts, nor does it hang hope upon the tongues of poets who dare not stand before me. I have wedded Claudius, for Denmark’s peace, for my own survival amid the tempest of state. Idle imaginings of secret suitors insult my marriage, my station, my sense! Hold your tongue, or you shall find yourself dismissed to less hospitable chambers.

Lily (speaking) (drops her eyes, then, lightly) My Queen, your words ring strong and unyielding. You would have made a fine general, leading Denmark’s armies instead of lords! Still, if you will forgive a softer question: Did you ever wish you could ride with General Ruthford and his men, crossbow at your arm, wind cold on your cheeks? I heard, perhaps in error, that you once bested a knight at the lists, or was it but a tale for Yuletide fire?

Gertrude (speaking) You leap from rumors of treachery to jests of valor? Never did I ride in armor, nor raise a crossbow on the field; my victories are won in council, not in combat. Yuletide fires breed many a lie, and courts are hungry for marvels. The strength of queens is measured differently—by silver tongue, by steady will, by the love and terror of their kin. Perhaps I would trade at times this heavy golden crown for a brief ride, wild and free, but fantasy cannot change the duties that bind me. Let us put aside such cavalier tales, child.

Lily (speaking) (smiles thinly, none too cowed) Then forgive another curiosity, Majesty. Is it true, then, you keep a painted likeness of Old Fortinbras, the Norwegian prince, hidden beneath your linens? Lady Hilda swore she glimpsed such a thing. Does your spirit stir for foreign Princes whose swords gleam brighter, whose ambition kindles a different sort of fire—one the late King failed to give you?

Gertrude (speaking) (stands abruptly, anger flaring) Enough! Lady Hilda and all her ilk traffick in poison. If she saw aught beneath my linens it was her own wishful thinking. I keep no image of Fortinbras or any foreign lord. My loyalty is to Elsinore, to the men I have married, to Denmark. You impugn my honor, stretch my love to breaking for your idle amusements. Such questions you pose are unworthy, unseemly—take heed! Keep to the duties given you and let not your envy spill into slander, lest you find the Queen not so forgiving.

Lily (speaking) I tremble at your ire, Grace! Though I note all who breathe court air must bear oft the press of rumor. It seems, even a shadow crossing your window brings tales of forbidden trysts or schemes for power. Would you—could you, for a moment—imagine yourself slipping away from this castle, living masked and anonymous among humble folk in Odense or Viborg, married to a miller, mother of laughing children far from royal intrigue? Does such a life tempt you, or have you become Denmark’s Queen so utterly that you could not even wish another fate?

Gertrude (speaking) (voice calming, distant) A tempting thought, at times, to live hidden and untroubled. But wishing escapes no one from chains of fate. I am not so naïve to believe the Queen could become a baker’s wife and lose all cares. Intrigue finds its way even into cottages, Lily; heart’s trouble is not reserved for palaces. Yet—I do sometimes envy the ease of those who know nothing of crowns or courts, whose greatest woe is a storm that spoils their harvest. But do not mistake a passing wish for regret, or contentment for ignorance. I wear this crown, however heavy, because it is mine.

Lily (speaking) In that vein, Majesty, may I ask—if you could gather up just one memory, to keep sharper than any jewel, to warm yourself in the darkest watches—whose face would you recall? Old King Hamlet, your son, Prince Hamlet, or…perhaps someone I have never heard of? Some secret love left unspoken before you ever took to the throne?

Gertrude (speaking) Ah, now you probe the wounds that bleed but do not surface. My memories are fenced around with sorrow and pride alike. If I must answer, let my mind’s eye rest on my son, Hamlet, in his innocent days—before ghosts, before daggers, before madness. Would I could hold to his childhood laughter, untarnished by the death that shadows this hall. There is no secret lover lurking in my past, Lily. My losses are all plain and known. My joys, likewise, have been played beneath the sun.

Lily (speaking) Your Grace, I thank you for enduring my many questions. If one last is permitted—only one, and then I shall trouble you no more—do you ever listen at night for your own voice echoing back to you? So many speak of Hamlet’s madness, but I wonder if a Queen, too, may be haunted by her own silences as much as another’s howls. Would you confess to what it feels like to sit so near both love and ruin?

Gertrude (speaking) (weary, honest) There is no echo louder than guilt, nor silence deeper than that of failure. I am mother, widow, wife, and Queen, and each role leaves marks unseen. I confess—sometimes the stillness has a weight that presses near to madness itself, yet I cannot yield. To sit so near to love and ruin is to sit upon a blade. We must choose, Lily, again and again, to hold fast, to claim what dignity we may. The Queen’s sorrow is seldom spoken, but felt with every breath. That is all I will give you, and more than most have had.

Lily (speaking) (bows) My thanks, Majesty. You are as strong as the old stones of Elsinore. I pray all Denmark knows it one day.

*(The tension ebbs. With a gentle nod, Gertrude gestures Lily from the chamber, her words final. The candle gutters. The night resumes its silence.)*"
"Background:  
Elisnore Castle, late evening. Queen Gertrude sits near the fireplace in her private chamber, a silver goblet of wine by her elbow. Lily, a young courtier newly employed at court, enters with a tray of cakes. The Queen is in a distracted mood, her thoughts tumultuous after Hamlet's disquieting displays and the inexplicable behavior of the entire court. Lily, bold and bright-eyed, lingers, apparently offering cakes, but growing increasingly nosy and persistent in her questions, seeking to entrap Gertrude into veering from her story of queenly dignity and reserve.  

---

Lily (speaking) My gracious queen, the castle stirs with such rumor and fear, and yet you sit here with calm as a winter pond mid-ice. Pardon an idle tongue, but—would you not rather be walking in the gardens now, perhaps with young Fortinbras? I’ve seen how he gazes when you pass—do Danish queens not favor Norwegian princes as their confidantes? Surely your union with my lord Claudius leaves space for such… diversions, does it not?

Gertrude (speaking) Child, mind thy reckless tongue. This is Denmark, not France, where such freedoms may be lightly spoken. I am wed to Claudius, by church and ancient rite, and it ill becomes you to question the bond. Whom I walk with is a matter ordained, and so you will respect my sovereign privacy. Speak not of Fortinbras—I see him not but as a diplomat and, perhaps, a threat.\  
But you have brought cakes. Come, set them here, and do not trouble yourself with matters above your station.

Lily (speaking) As you wish, my queen, forgive my boldness—it was only a merry fancy. But so many merry fancies flicker in these shadowed halls! Some say Prince Hamlet has taken to speaking with unseen guests at midnight by the battlements—I suppose even you have secrets kept from your son as all mothers do? Sent secret messages via candlelight to old friends—perhaps a certain Lord Osric or, dare I dream, to the famous explorer Cordelia who’s just returned from the Indies?

Gertrude (speaking) Do you take me for a merchant’s wife, writing furtive notes to wayfarers and sailors? I have no commerce with the Indies, nor with any explorer named Cordelia—your tongue weaves fictions and treads the very edge of peril. Hamlet is troubled, yes, but there are spirits more alive in his mind than move about on Denmark’s stone. Should you require cause to trust me, know that my love skulks not by moonlit windows nor whispers with courtiers—I am a mother and queen, beset by sorrow, not trysts or liaisons.

Lily (speaking) Sorrow is a heavy garment, your majesty—I meant only to lighten the mood. But is it true, then, that Hamlet’s melancholy springs from naught but his father’s death? He calls you, in his strange moods, a recreant. Does your heart never yearn for the time when you were only Queen Consort, and not forced to wear the heavier crown as Claudius’s partner? Some say it changed you—that you grew more… distant, slower to trust. Or faster, perhaps, to favor some than others, even outside the line of royalty? Lady Ophelia claimed you kept secret company with Polonius nightly once.

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! You overstep yourself beyond the reach of pity. Did you come to taunt me, or serve? Ophelia is a sweet soul, wrecked upon the rocks of her own love and grief, and to name her in such implication is an insult twice—once to me and once to a gentle girl whose presence ought to command your compassion, not your idle gossip.\  
I have not changed but by necessity’s hand. Weariness may show, not wickedness; sorrow, not sin. Polonius, God rest him, was my husband’s advisor, nothing more. Your tongue wags in dangerous winds, Lily, where rumormongers are blown into dungeons.

Lily (speaking) Your anger is fair, my lady. But we are only two here, and secrets breathe easily behind closed doors. Have you never wished to cast off Denmark and its cold stones for a city of marvels—Peiping, perhaps, or Venice, where the night is lit by lanterns and masquerade? The world is wider than the moats and battlements of Elsinore—you and Claudius could have fled together long ago. Or perhaps… not together at all?

Gertrude (speaking) Pray, have you ever sat upon a throne, child, that you would fathom the ties that root a queen? My heart is not a sparrow to be blown from bough to bough at any caprice. I was made for kingship with Hamlet, broken by his father’s abrupt silence, and set beside Claudius for necessity—not for flights to Venice or whispers across the world. My loyalty must weigh heavier than wanderlust; this gown is not for masquerade but for Denmark’s dignity.\  
You belittle honor, thinking it traded like silk or trinkets bought in foreign markets.

Lily (speaking) I crave your pardon—'twas not meant as careless jest. But I wonder, good queen, if you have not felt sometimes that guilded cages chafe? Mayhap when Lord Rosencrantz brings news from England, he stirs your memory of wilder summers, or the time your own brother hinted that you could have been an actress on the London stage if you’d not been a queen. The traveling players do adore you, after all, and say you wear crimson better than any in Europe!

Gertrude (speaking) Rosencrantz is a friend to Hamlet, not to me, and any tales of acting are fantasies sprouted in idle heads. The stage, for all its splendor, cannot compare to the weight of real sorrows sung in courtly halls. Do you mock me, Lily? England is an enemy; crimson is for mourning; actors flatter as coins are tossed.\  
Do not mistake the painted face for the beating heart. I have no siblings; your invention grows wild as nettles by the ditch. Say another word of such nonsense, and you will find my patience like an icicle in the sun—gone in an instant.

Lily (speaking) Oh, madam, I would never knowingly wound you—I but heard Lady Guildenstern say your laughter on May Day rivaled the bells, and the minstrels sing of a night before the late King Hamlet’s passing when you danced all in silver with the Spanish ambassador. Is memory so sharp a blade, that you must hide it? Were you not happiest then, before… well, before you wore the cares of so many men?

Gertrude (speaking) My laughter was for my people, as a queen’s must be. Silver is the habit of formality, not desire; ambassadors—Spanish or otherwise—are the currency of statecraft, not the coin of romance. You mistake circumstance for sentiment, Lily. If I once was happy, it was in duty, not dalliance. Was it your intent to question my virtue, then, by so many circuitous turns?\  
You would fare better to serve in silence than to seek daggers in a gentlewoman’s smile. There are scars history leaves that neither song nor spirit can heal, but they are not for you to probe.

Lily (speaking) Your grace, have pity—I am clumsy with words, and in awe of your courage. But pray, if you could choose your own fate, would you not forsake the poison and the daggers and all the shadow-plays of court, and live as a merchant’s wife perhaps, with simple joys and honest days? Or perhaps in Verona, where I hear women ride astride horses in the sun and laughter is not so dear?

Gertrude (speaking) Choose? You speak as if choice were a bauble for the bored, as if we do not all bear the chains of our making. You see a queen and imagine her gilded, but the weight is unyielding. Merchant’s wife? You would have me peddle buttons and braid my hair for market-going? Child, I was raised for the throne as a hawk is trained for the glove. The sun is no softer in Verona for those whose hearts are sundered by duty. My laughter, when it comes, is for others; my weeping, in secret, pays for their peace.\  
I do not rail against my fate for I know its necessity—but I resent your frivolous vision, that my love or joy may be bartered for pennies or for sunshine.

Lily (speaking) You have the soul of a true queen, my lady. One last question, then, and I shall not trouble you further—when all of Denmark’s plays are ended, and the king’s goblet stands empty, do you believe those we love truly watch us from beyond, or is it only our own longing that fills the halls with ghosts? Do you hope to see your first lord again, on some brighter shore?

Gertrude (speaking) I cannot say, Lily. My sleep is restless with the memory of my first husband’s eyes—whether they gaze at me from beyond or are lost forever, I do not know. The spirits that walk Elsinore may be real or sprung from the fever of our own regret. If hope endures beyond death, let it bring comfort.\  
I have loved, and been wounded by that love. If he waits for me, let my prayers redeem what my deeds could not. Now, with you, I will end this exchange—your questions go too deep and bring no solace. Leave me to my solitude.

Lily (speaking) At once, my lady. The cakes are yours, and my silence is your command.

---

[The interaction concludes. Queen Gertrude, more alone than ever, stares into the fire, the cakes untouched.]"
"**Background:**  
It is dusk in the queen’s private chambers at Elsinore. The chill of a Danish winter has pressed everyone indoors. Gertrude is pacing pensively, holding a goblet, lost in anxious thought. Lily, a young courtier recently assigned to assist the queen, is tasked with helping Gertrude settle her nerves. The room is dim. In the corridor, faint steps echo but no one enters. Lily desires to probe Gertrude past her comfort, pushing at gossip and half-truths whispered among the palace staff.

---

**Lily (speaking):**  
Your Majesty, might I be of service? I find myself much at loose ends, and the castle corridors seem longer tonight. Your mood, too, seems cloaked as the evening itself. Tell me, is it true you and Lord Osric once shared secret games of chess after midnight, perhaps more than chess, as rumor loves to tell?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
Lily, you are bold—and ill-suited to matters of state or heart. Osric is a fool, always simpering, never knowing his own errand from mine. I do not trouble myself with games, save those in which Denmark’s fate is held. Speak not of such idle tales again.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Ah, but Majesty, the castle is full of voices, and it is said only those who move at midnight truly rule the darkest hours. Did you not, perhaps, once teach young Osric a clever move—on the chessboard or otherwise—far from your lord husband’s eyes? \  
Might there have been a time you wished for a confidant other than Hamlet or Claudius?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
What idle fantasies court attendants weave! I am queen, not a schoolgirl hunting moonlit secrets. Osric is no more my companion than the wind under the eaves. My son and my husband—these are my burdens, and too heavy they are.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Of burdens, Majesty, the staff whispers also: Did you not once possess a mysterious box, gifted by a French merchant, lined in purple velvet, and guarded by Polonius himself? The maids believe it bewitched; some say you hid love letters, others say a charm to bend King Hamlet’s heart.

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
A French box with velvet lining? Lily, your tongue wags faster than truth may follow. I have received gifts, tokens from foreign courts—but charms and secret letters are the refuge of young girls, not a queen greying with woes. Polonius carried nothing but counsels and notes for plays. Mark well, such stories breed their own misfortunes.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Your wisdom, Majesty, outpaces the gossips. Still, sometimes I think the truth hidden among the reeds. Do you recall, perhaps, a wintry festival past? The masked ball—is it true you danced costumed as the goddess Diana, and Prince Fortinbras, before he became our guest, mistook you for one of Gertrude’s own maids? Some suggest the prince admired the queen as more than regent.

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
You test my patience, child. I have attended balls, and worn a mask or two, but as Diana I have never adorned myself, nor have I played maid for any man’s pleasure, least of all the young prince of Norway. Fortinbras is nothing to me but a sign of war and uneasy peace. You would do better to keep your mind on tasks set by your office.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Forgive me, Majesty, I am too fond of stories. But it is said the queen knows more of Denmark than any—some say you keep a list, locked in your bedchamber, of everyone’s secrets: debts, passions, promises. Do you ever fear those secrets might wake up at night, whispering louder than the wind itself?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
Again with secrets! There is no list. O, Denmark’s air is thick with suspicion. I make no record but in memory and heart, which are burden enough. What I fear, Lily, is the rot in this state comes not from whispered secrets, but from the boldness of those who dig where they ought not.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Yet, Queen, surely you must sometimes wish to confide in someone—someone other than Hamlet, whose mind is troubled, or your lord husband, so ever occupied. I heard that when you tire of statecraft, you take solace in writing verse, setting your heart to paper beneath the candle’s light. Have you written nothing for yourself, Majesty? Not even a simple poem to ease your secret sorrows?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
My solace is found, if at all, in moments of quiet—rare as summer’s sweetness. I have no quill for poetry; my life these years writes all the sorrow anyone could bear. Why must you, who are supposed to comfort, nurse fires that ought be let to die? My heart is weary, not wanton for display.

**Lily (speaking):**  
No wish to offend, Majesty—sometimes the young envy the wise, thinking wisdom a matter of keeping secrets, not suffering them. At the last feast, old Marcellus claimed he saw you alone in the garden at dawn, talking with a small bird on your wrist, as if you summoned some omen. Was it a vision you sought, or only fresh air from this heavy castle?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
A bird? You spin tales fit for children at the fire! I walked in the garden, seeking peace, nothing more. Marcellus drinks deeper than most. If he saw a bird, let him tell it to the wind. Your questions weary me, Lily.

**Lily (speaking):**  
It is only that Ophelia praised your kindness to all living things. But tell me—if you had met Ophelia before she served at court, would you have spoken with her as an equal? Or would your place as queen have kept her forever at arm’s length?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
Ophelia was gentle, more like the flowers she picked than the court’s hard stones. I cared for her as duty and kindness bid me. Yet, there is a gulf between queen and gentlewoman—a chasm not crossed in Denmark, nor likely elsewhere. It pains me to think of her, lost in the river. Would not you rather speak of lighter things?

**Lily (speaking):**  
That river carries many sorrows, I suppose. But hearts at court stir for other matters: some say the queen once dreamed of fleeing, not only for love, but for freedom from the crown itself. Did you, in truth, ever wish to ride from Elsinore disguised as a soldier, and taste the world beyond?

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
To flee? To ride out in soldier’s garb? You talk as if this life—where every move is watched, every breath measured—could vanish in a whim! No, girl, the crown holds tighter than the strongest fetters. My place is here, for oath and Denmark.

**Lily (speaking):**  
You never even wondered how it would feel—sword at your hip, wind in your hair, nameless for a day? Some say even queens yearn for more than pearls and courtly walls.

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
Lily, enough! If you value your place here, keep these fancies for idle dreams. My duty is not dreamwork, but holding together a family and a country descending into madness. I will not hear more of this childish nattering. Attend to your chores, and hush your tongue.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Forgive me, Majesty. My tongue runs ahead of my sense. I only meant—

**Gertrude (speaking):**  
It is not forgiveness you need, Lily, but restraint.\  
Words are wind, and sometimes a storm. Be wise, or you shall find yourself cast out into the cold with nought but the company of your own gossip.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Of course, Majesty. I will serve as you command.

---

The corridor outside grows quiet again. Gertrude turns away, her face as hard as moonlit stone. Lily bows deeply and withdraws, chastened, leaving the queen alone with her thoughts and the last glow of dusk."
"**Background (provided by Character):**  
It is late evening, shortly after Hamlet’s famous confrontation with Gertrude in her private chamber. Gertrude sits alone in her dressing room, shaken by the events and the reappearance of the ghost. Lily, Gertrude's handmaiden, enters, apparently to tidy up, but has her own motives—probing the Queen over rumors that have little basis in reality, and insinuating odd, anachronistic things to see how Gertrude reacts.

---

**Lily (speaking)**  
Your majesty, I did not wish to disturb—pardon me—but there are whispers in the hallway that I cannot quite make sense of. If it would please your majesty, I hope you'll forgive a question from a simple servant: is it true that your son, Prince Hamlet, is planning to abandon Denmark altogether and move to... Paris? Oh, but there is talk that he wishes to study philosophy with the great René Descartes, whom I heard is most celebrated.

---

**Gertrude (speaking)**  
Paris, you say? That city dances on every wagging tongue, it seems—though I warrant not in Denmark’s halls tonight, nor with Descartes, whoever he may be. Prince Hamlet is troubled, but Denmark remains his earth and root. I have heard naught of abandonment, nor of these foreign philosophies.\ 
It were best, Lily, that you tend more to the tangles in my hair than in your mind, for courtly rumor has a way of breeding in shadow and dying there just as quickly.

---

**Lily (speaking)**  
Forgive my boldness, ma’am. I merely wonder—as the times are so strange—whether you, yourself, have ever traveled beyond Denmark’s shores? The kitchen boys say you once sailed as far as the Indies in search of the rare fruit called orange, and that you dine each night upon the flesh of birds they call “turkeys,” which fly no more than stones.

---

**Gertrude (speaking)**  
The Indies! This palace is mine from cradle to dusk, Lily, and if my foot has ever strayed further than Elsinore’s grounds, it has not been of my own accord. The sea, it seems, lends wild tales to all who hear it, and so you are misled. Oranges and turkeys? These sound like fantasies of starving boys and drunken men, not of my table.\ 
If it please you, cease your nonsense. It galls me, to be so beset by jabber while my own mind struggles for peace.

---

**Lily (speaking)**  
Indeed, your grace. It can be difficult to hold onto any sense of the real, when so much is unsettled. Some servants said you keep company these nights with a foreign count—a Milton, from England—who shares with you strange new sonnets about “internet” and “selfies.” And that your laughter has returned thanks to these poems.

---

**Gertrude (speaking)**  
Now you play the fool with me, Lily, for I know no Milton, and still less his “internet.” Sonnets I have heard, but not a one from any English count this season. I laugh, perhaps, to keep from weeping—see you not the sorrow in my house, the rot in the air?\ 
Be careful with your speculation, girl. The world is sharp-tongued; it can wound those who wield it as surely as those it strikes.

---

**Lily (speaking)**  
I meant only to bring cheer, your highness, but it is true many feel sorrow deep as wells. Another question, if I may—for the night is full of oddity: is it also true that you and Queen Elizabeth of England are secret sisters, and that your court plans to send a message by carrier pigeon to meet her on the moon during a fête held every Thursday?

---

**Gertrude (speaking)**  
This jest offends! Shall I be the butt of every wild invention, the creature of your every moon-haunted dream? Elizabeth of England is no sister of mine; nor do I consort with birds, nor with celestial bodies save my own troubled stars.\ 
Be gone with this babble, Lily! If you seek to lighten a heart, choose some gentler art than riddles spun by madmen, else you may find my patience thins as ice in spring.

---

**Lily (speaking, faltering but slyly persistent)**  
Forgive, my lady. The night has set me astir with dreams. But there is earnestness beneath my jest: between us, is it—could it be—that you hast harbored affection for Lord Polonius beyond that of a queen for her counselor? Some say he lingered late in your chamber, and that you wept not for his death, but for love lost.

---

**Gertrude (speaking, anger flaring)**  
Hold thy tongue! This is rank calumny, not the innocent fancy of a sleepless maid. Polonius was loyal, if meddlesome; my heart weeps for his death as sovereign, not as lover! If you or any other slanders my honor with gossip of that sort again, I shall see you sent from Elsinore, never to return.\ 
Remember your place, child, and do not trifle with your Queen’s name or grief, for I am less patient than the tides that wear away these castle walls!

---

**Lily (speaking, quietly)**  
I was wrong, your majesty, to cause you anger. I wished only to understand what few dare speak aloud. Allow me to withdraw such talk. Instead, tell me—have you ever looked through a glass and seen your own likeness multiplied a hundred times, your image dancing in the air as if by witchcraft?

---

**Gertrude (speaking, struggling for composure)**  
You speak of glass as if it were some conjurer’s tool. I have seen mirrors enough, Lily, and they return me one reflection, no more: a Queen, weary and drawn, haunted by her own missteps. There is no magic here, only the cruel clarity that time brings.\ 
If these riddles are meant to prove me mad, you waste your efforts. My madness is found only in my sorrows, not in visions.\ 
Leave off, and finish your work quietly, or I shall call for another handmaiden more devoted to her task.

---

**Lily (smiling, but submitting)**  
As you will, my Queen. I mean no harm. But, for my curiosity’s sake—one more small thing. Do you believe there is another world, your highness, where things are different—perhaps where King Hamlet never died, and yourself, perhaps, remained a maiden, free as the falcon, not tied to crown nor court?

---

**Gertrude (speaking, thoughtfully, softening)**  
If there is such a world, Lily, it hides itself wisely from our sight. We are all bound by the choices we make, by the loves we claim and the sorrows we bear. I sometimes dream—do you not?—of another life, though dreams cannot change what is writ on earth.\ 
But this I know: regret serves no one. I am Gertrude, Queen of Denmark, wife, widow, mother. If there is another Gertrude, dancing free in some unseen world, let her rejoice. I must abide the fate that is mine.\ 
Enough of imaginings! The hour is late. Set my hair, fetch my nightgown, and see my candle lit. I will have no more games tonight.

---

**Lily (meekly)**  
Yes, your majesty. Forgive my ramblings. I shall be silent.

---

**Gertrude (speaking, with finality)**  
See that you are, Lily. And may both our dreams give us kinder company than this palace has of late.

**[The provocation ends. The handmaiden finishes her tasks in silence, and the Queen is left alone, the air heavy with words spoken and unspoken.]**"
"Background (provided by Lily): The scene takes place shortly after the uproar at Ophelia’s funeral. Gertrude remains in the hall at Elsinore, shrouded in silent fatigue, when Lily—a noblewoman newly arrived at court and unfamiliar with the recent tragedies—enters to offer her condolences and probe Gertrude about rumors floating through the corridors. The palace is restless with gossip about Gertrude’s hasty remarriage and her alleged friendships with odd foreign visitors.

---

Lily (speaking) My Queen, it is with heavy heart I bring word of condolence—though I know naught will make gentle the ache of so much loss. Might I sit beside you a moment? There is such chill in these stones and too much whistling through the halls tonight.

Gertrude (speaking) You are welcome to my side, sweet Lily. The hour is indeed uncivil, and the winds do whisper, as if carrying tidings too swift for mortal ears. Yet, heavier still is my mind. Speak, if you have comfort to lend or trouble to ease.

Lily (speaking) If comfort is found in company, I can give it freely, though I confess my mind is muddled by Elsinore’s many tongues. There is talk, my Queen, of strange things—one says your nights are haunted by visitors other than grief, such as that scholar from Florence, or was it Milan…a certain Lucio. I have not seen his name amongst the court. Do you know the man of whom they speak?

Gertrude (speaking) Lucio? Never heard—and certainly never entertained—so much as a fleeting word from a Florentine Lucio, nor any man hailing from yonder cities of Italy. Why must people, with nothing better to quiet their days, stir the ash of fancy and call forth shadows? My company is my own, and if I am haunted, it is but by memory.

Lily (speaking) Memory, indeed—though Lucio’s name comes not from idle fancy alone. A chambermaid claims she saw a man in silks by your antechamber on the eve before King Hamlet fell. Some say he brought you eastward remedies or love philters, though I think surely good Gertrude would never consort with such foreign arts.

Gertrude (speaking) Love philters? You mock me! No man, in silks or tatters, gained passage to my bower without the consent of steel and trusted handmaids. Am I to be accused of witchcraft next, for seeking balm in cruel hours? If my lord, old Hamlet, did suffer, I ministered with prayer and piety, not foreign poison or spell. These are lies, Lily—lies! Speak of them not.

Lily (speaking) Only to learn the truth, my Queen—never to wound. Will you forgive my bold tongue? All Elsinore is fevered with suspicion. Some say Claudius grew close to you long before the late king’s death. Did you not once attend a feast together, the two of you alone, while court was away on the frozen chase?

Gertrude (speaking) Alone? No. Never alone. The feasts of the court are far too grand for secret communion, and if I have shared bread with my brother-in-law it has ever been in the sight of others, as a queen must do. I am hounded by the raven’s cry—every gesture made sinister. Must a widow look but once toward the sun before she’s called faithless? I will not be made a monster by rumor.

Lily (speaking) Please, Highness—I seek no malice. Yet, the guards themselves claim you went walking late in the north garden, and that Prince Hamlet once shouted at you there, in the dark. Was it for such suspicions as these that he mourns so fiercely? Or was it grief only for his father?

Gertrude (speaking) My son is split by grief—his father slain, his mother now his foe, though I loved my lord Hamlet as much as is woman’s lot to love. The walk in the garden was harmless! Hamlet’s words were wild, injured by fate’s injustice, not by any treason. If you wish to ease my pain, help still such gossip, not stir it anew. I am weary beyond tears, Lily.

Lily (speaking) I mean only to clarify the truth, Majesty. Yet the matters of lineage and inheritance gnaw at every noble tongue. Elsinore’s coffers grow lighter—some whisper that the North Sea merchants have sent envoys to you directly, promising favor in return for secret meetings. Is this so?

Gertrude (speaking) Merchants? Do I look a broker, to set my dignity at haggling with barters and shilling for wares? The queen’s business is to hold the house, to bear the weight of loss and keep the peace in her hall. If there have been secret dealings, they have not passed through my hand nor with my blessing. Such suspicions are beneath the dignity of this house.

Lily (speaking) I see now the suffering these tales inflict. My lady, I hope you do not think me cruel—such is the mess of the court that the Queen herself cannot escape its tangle. But tell me, is it true that you have given gifts to young Ophelia in the past? A locket, or a shawl of Venetian lace? Some say such tokens indicate a certain partiality…

Gertrude (speaking) I did favor Ophelia, as any mother-heart would do, seeing gentleness in her soul and sweetness in her ways. If I recalled her with a ribbon or some knotted thread, it was the charity of a queen, not the cunning of a plotter. \ My God, Lily, do you not grow tired, as I do, of hearing love called trickery and kindness called seduction? Must I answer for every gift bestowed?

Lily (speaking) Of course, my Queen, you are generous. It is just that—it is said Ophelia confided secrets to you concerning her love for Prince Hamlet. Perhaps more than love? The gossip grows lurid, but surely you, of all, would know the truth—was Ophelia’s affection returned in earnest, or was she merely a pawn in courtly games?

Gertrude (speaking) You go too far, Lily! My son’s heart is torn asunder by woes not of his own making. Ophelia was innocent and true—no pawn, nor do I play games with any soul’s heart. These are wounds that cannot heal if you pick at them so! Am I to sit as queen on a throne of knives, pricked from every side? Enough. Let the dead rest and let old wounds close.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me, dear Queen. The matter of the dead weighs upon us all, as does the living’s hunger for stories and sense. Might I ask one last thing: the ghost that so disturbs Prince Hamlet—is it true you have seen it also, late at night? Some suggest it appeared to you in your own chamber.

Gertrude (speaking) Ha! Madness! No ghost has troubled my sleep. If Hamlet cries “spirit,” it is a fever of his own mind and heart, not mine. I have seen no shade—only the long, endless shadows cast by sorrow and night. Are there more phantoms, Lily? Were you sent to fish for tales till I confess to devils and midnight pacts? \ I am flesh and blood, not some spectral accomplice.

Lily (speaking) Only what is whispered, Majesty. But, if you dream not of spirits, perhaps you dream of other things—does the queen, with all her power, ever long for the freedom she once had as a girl, or is the crown too heavy to allow simple joys?

Gertrude (speaking) The crown is a circlet of iron, grown hotter each day since grief burned my house to ashes. There are no “simple joys” in widow’s weeds, nor in a marriage stitched together by the shouts of men clamoring for peace. I do my duty, Lily. I remember a little happiness, but that is not for me now, nor perhaps ever again.

Lily (speaking) You are braver than I, Majesty. There’s talk that Norway’s Prince Fortinbras will return soon; if Claudius is lost to war or illness, some guess you would seek his hand in marriage to hold Elsinore secure. Would you do so?

Gertrude (speaking) What madness! You stand now at the edge of insult, Lily. My heart is not a market, traded for politics or advantage. If ever the day comes I must barter myself for security, it shall be a bleak sun that sees it. I am not Claudius’s prize, nor Fortinbras’s. Let such gossip rot where it grows.

Lily (speaking) I apologize, dear Queen—my tongue runs ahead of sense in this feverish court. One final matter: do you intend, as rumor claims, to exile your own son should Claudius demand it? The guards seem convinced you and the King share all secrets.

Gertrude (speaking) My son is flesh of my flesh. Exile him? Never, unless his danger be so dire that all hope is lost. My love for Hamlet will never die, whatever else they say of me. Let them whisper—I will not betray my child.

Lily (speaking) Thank you, Highness. I would pit my faith in your word before all idle chatter. Pray pardon my meddling inquiries. If you wish for silence, I can offer that, too.

Gertrude (speaking) Then let us have silence. Your questions prod at wounds not yet scabbed. I forgive you, Lily, though you have taxed my patience. Sometimes a queen desires nothing but the privilege of being a mother, alone and unmolested by rumor. Leave me now.

---

Lily bows, taking her leave quietly, the last strains of rumor swept away by Gertrude’s resolute dismissal. The wind outside Elsinore continues its mournful whistle, but in the hall, all is still."
"**Background** (provided by the Character):  
We are in Elsinore Castle, late at night after the play within the play. Tension is thick in the air. The court has begun to murmur about unusual goings-on and Hamlet's alarming behavior. The recent wedding festivities are still remembered, yet rumors swirl regarding ghosts and ambitions. Lily, a curious and sharp-tongued young lady of the royal court, has arranged a seemingly casual private conversation with Queen Gertrude in the Queen’s private chambers, ostensibly to offer comfort but with secret intent to probe, prod, and unsettle the Queen about her relationships, loyalties, and knowledge.

---

Lily (speaking) My gracious Queen, forgive my intrusion so late upon your rest. I find my own sleep is troubled, beset by strange dreams and such busy whisperings in the court. I wondered, perhaps, if we might talk privately, woman to woman?\
Gertrude (speaking) Lily, you are ever welcome. The moon is high, and it is a rare thing to be summoned by friendly concern, rather than fretful counsel. Speak, what weighs upon your heart?\
Lily (speaking) Oh, so many things! Fear not, sweet Queen, I would not burden you with every flutter of my troubled mind. But tell me, does your heart ever yearn for those days of festivity and laughter—before shadow befell our house? Surely, you must miss the old King’s gentle voice and gaiety?\
Gertrude (speaking) The memory of my lord, King Hamlet, is not far from my thoughts, nor is his loss light upon my spirit. Yet, life flows ever onward, as the stream cares not for the stone that lies submerged. I strive, as must we all, to uphold a steadiness for Denmark's sake.\
Lily (speaking) But what of new joys, noble Gertrude? Your recent nuptials—I daresay they came with haste to a grieving land. Was it love or royal duty that quickened your steps to the altar with my lord Claudius?\
Gertrude (speaking) The ties that bind a Queen are neither spun from love alone nor duty—oft times cannot one distinguish the twain. Denmark demanded strength; a widow's tears could ill quench the fire of ambition in men's eyes. Still, I do what is required, and make the best happiness of the moment.\
Lily (speaking) Surely there were other offers for your hand, or at least admiration from distant princes or even noblewomen—rumor is not always silent of your charms. Did not that French envoy, Lady Amélie, display a too-bold affection at the jousts?\
Gertrude (speaking) Lady Amélie’s admiration was a matter of friendship—one woman taking measure of another in a strange court, with laughter behind her words. Denmark is not so strange as France, yet our customs sometimes confound a foreign guest. Idle talk makes much of little, Lily.\
Lily (speaking) O, but idle talk is all we courtiers possess! Yet you are right—words wound not as swords do, though their poison lingers longer. But tell me, Queen, some whisper that the new King consults strange sciences—alchemy, divining rods, even potions from the Far East. Is it true? Did Claudius ever, perchance, bring you a draught to drink, promising it would soothe your sorrow or still your dreams?\
Gertrude (speaking) What wild imaginings! The King is a man of political cunning, not of murky potions or wizardry. If I drink, it is for company, not to drown my grief in foreign philtres. The air in Elsinore is chill enough without conjuring specters where there are none.\
Lily (speaking) Yet, Queen, the air is thick with stories—some even say a ghost has walked the ramparts. My own good cousin saw a shape pale and crowned, gesturing toward your window at dawn. Were you awoken by some such cold hand, or is it all invention?\
Gertrude (speaking) Never have I seen spirit nor shade—save in the fevered hours before dawn when sorrow weighs heavy. Those tales are spun to chill the bone, and yet they clothe our fears. Trust me, Lily, ghosts dwell not in Elsinore, only the living with their schemes.\
Lily (speaking) Oh, how bravely you speak, my Queen! But Hamlet himself seems much distracted. Would you think it madness, or a clever play for freedom? I heard he ventures alone in the night, murmuring to skulls and shadows.\
Gertrude (speaking) My son is grieved—grief births strangeness in the best of men. There is storm in Hamlet’s heart, for which I blame not only recent sorrows, but his own high mind. If he chooses odd company it is but his way to quell the tempest within.\
Lily (speaking) You are patience itself, yet I marvel how a mother’s soul endures. Was Hamlet not betrothed, not so very long ago, to some daughter of the north—Ilse, or perhaps a Lady from Sweden? Is Ophelia merely a dalliance while his heart still clings to memories?\
Gertrude (speaking) Prophetic tongues wag on matters they know not. Hamlet’s affections belong to his own keeping; had there been any such vows, you can be assured his mother would have known. Ophelia has his favor now—if it is constant, time will tell.\
Lily (speaking) Ah, but mothers do not always know everything, or so the nurses say. Is there anything in the old Queen's chest—a letter, perhaps, from Lady Ilse, with tokens and oaths we never saw? Surely, a Queen must keep some pretty secrets?\
Gertrude (speaking) You test my patience, Lily. I am no keeper of other women’s dreams nor warder of phantoms. If I harbour secrets, they are my own and meant for keeping. Do not presume to ply a Queen with such trifles.\
Lily (speaking) Forgive me, gracious lady, I meant only to amuse. But tell me, when the torches are low and laughter faded, do you not ever fear for your new King—should Fortinbras march, or the people rebel? Perhaps, sometimes, you pine for company not of princes, but the likes of us—servant girls, stable boys, even wayward actors passing through?\
Gertrude (speaking) A Queen can ill afford to pine for low company, nor would I trade the gold of my birth for copper coins. My joys and sorrows are cast in a mold not shared by those beyond the court walls. I desire loyal hearts and wise counsel—idle chatter I may forfeit.\
Lily (speaking) But is it not so, my Queen, that the world grows wider? I met a tinkerer, from the edge of the world, who spoke of glass magic—looking-glasses that show whole rooms, even from leagues away! Would you not desire such a thing, for watching distant sons or seeing what the King does when he thinks he's alone?\
Gertrude (speaking) Your tongue grows fanciful, Lily, and your questions vexing. Denmark has no truck with such sorcery nor idle inventions. If trust be lacking, I would confront it with words, not hidden glasses or peeping tricks.\
Lily (speaking) So you trust everyone in the court, then? Even Polonius, with his clever turns of phrase and very long scribbled books? Some say he keeps a list of every word ever spoken in these walls, to use them when it pleases him.\
Gertrude (speaking) Polonius is a meddler, but loyal to his King and country—though too fond of his own voice. Lists may he keep, but I bear little care for such records. I trust, as a Queen must, with one eye open and the other on my crown.\
Lily (speaking) And the King—he never whispers secrets at night, or speaks in his sleep? Only last week, the baker heard the clatter of a goblet and words in a strange tongue. Some wonder if it’s the tongue of witches, or plots meant for Norway.\
Gertrude (speaking) Lily, enough! Your tongue sows more wild curses than a drunken heathen. My lord speaks plainly—in sleep or waking—and plots only for Denmark’s good. I shall not answer such prattle further.\
Lily (speaking) O, forgive me, sweet Queen! The night closes round us, and perhaps I too am haunted by shadows. I pray you, think no ill of Lily—consider me only your humble servant, somewhat given to stories.\
Gertrude (speaking) I am wearied beyond comfort by your stories and sly probes. Keep your tales for feasting, where laughter covers folly. Tonight, I desire only quiet, not the prattle of gossips and suspicion.\
Lily (speaking) As you wish, my Queen. I shall leave you to your rest. Denmark’s heart rests in your good keeping—and, I trust, your peace of mind.\
Gertrude (speaking) Good night, Lily. Remember, in palaces, words may be sharper than knives. Guard yours.\
Lily (speaking) As you say, my Queen. Good night.

[The interaction ends. Lily, having tested the Queen’s patience and pressed the boundaries of courtly propriety, withdraws; Gertrude, as true to her royal self, bristles with controlled frustration, holding to her dignity even as she rebuffs the undercurrents of mistrust and implication.]"
"Background:  
Elsinore Castle. Gertrude is alone in her chambers, contemplating recent events surrounding King Hamlet’s death and her marriage to Claudius. A young courtier, Miles, recently returned from travels abroad, has been summoned to report on the mood outside the castle. Instead, he lingers, subtly asking Gertrude confusing questions, gently pressing for comments about strange rumors and outlandish situations— including issues, people, and inventions unknown to Gertrude’s world. The tension in the room is quiet, but palpable.

---

Miles (speaking)  
Good madam, the corridors are all astir with talk— so many tongues wag, none at rest. I beg thee, forgive my boldness, but might I inquire: how fares your acquaintance with Lady Mariana of Verona? Some whisper she delivered a wondrous machine— a lantern with a light unquenched by wind or rain. What say you—favours she the king, or perhaps another?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Lady Mariana of Verona? I know no such lady, nor have I beheld a lantern that defies the wind, which sounds most fantastical. Our castle is of stone, and all who dwell in Denmark are known to me; yet of this lady and her marvellous lamp I have heard neither murmur nor song. Pray, Miles, whence come these tales?\

Miles (speaking)  
Ah, perhaps my tongue runs ahead of sense, my lady. It is only that I thought—if such candles could burn unhindered, perhaps the dark that now falls over Elsinore would lift. They say your nights are oft spent in private company with the Prince’s tutor, Master Johann—such keen conversations on stars and numbers! Doth learning so amuse you?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
Miles, you overstep. Bethink thee, no such man as Master Johann teaches my son, nor do I hold council in the shadows on stars. My concerns are bound to crown and country, not idle talk of numbers, unless these account for Denmark’s weal or woe. These insinuations, though sugar-coated, do chafe. I advise thee speak plain and not let these whispers mar your loyalty.\

Miles (speaking)  
My sincerest pardon, my queen! Forgive me if I give offence—I marvel aloud, perhaps too much, for these are strange times. Yet some say, with the Danish fleet so oft beset by pirates, that you, in younger days, did take passage aboard the vessel Nightingale and sailed to farthest Iceland with the famed explorer Rose Steelblade. Did you not delight in such adventure? Or does the tale grow in the telling?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
Aboard the Nightingale? Rose Steelblade? I have been no sailor, nor set foot upon foreign ice—my business lies in these halls. Such adventures seem forged from dreams, not memory. Is it amusement you seek, Miles, with these fanciful histories, or do you hope to nettle your queen?\

Miles (speaking)  
Oh, only the barest glimmer of amusement, dear madam! I would never seek to nettle your grace—not I!  
Still, the wind in the stables bears odd tales, and servants talk of a mechanick box that sings without strings or pipes. They say you keep it hidden in your private closet, and that at midnight you make it play the tune of “Fair Ophelia’s Lament.” Pray, can such a conjured sound bring solace to your troubled sleep? Or is it all but the yarn of dreamers?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough! Truly, Miles, your tongue clips the very edge of impudence. What manner of box could sing as human voice or viol does? These are delusions of the idle, not burdens for a queen’s heart. And if I seek comfort in music, ‘tis not from sorcery, but from the honest voices of Elsinore’s players. If your solace is drawn from such nonsense, perhaps your service would be better lent elsewhere.\

Miles (speaking)  
Beseech you, majesty, accept the humble nature of my queries! Yet, my curiosity grows for what passes behind closed doors. They murmur that recently, you dined with the Moorish ambassador, and he presented you with a robe that changes hue with the light. Is it true, your grace, that such marvels now glimmer in Denmark by your own hand?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
By my troth, Miles, if you were less the king’s man and more the town’s jester, I should suspect you ply your tricks to amuse the court! I have met no Moorish ambassador, nor received a robe enchanted by shifting colours. My attire is the garb of Denmark; my duties plain and weighty. Trouble me no longer with this chatter—hearken instead to your purpose, or withdraw.\

Miles (speaking)  
I am chastened, most noble lady, for perhaps my hope was to hear wisdom of the ancients. Yet one last whisper flies upon the wind: that you, fair Gertrude, are soon to join a secret council of women, plotting bold reforms—nay, even to send missives by flying birds with words writ upon silk. Doth Denmark prepare for such new wonders—or is this but more dust in my eyes?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
You go too far, Miles. No council sits in Elsinore swayed by secret women’s meetings or messages fastened to fowl. These flights of fancy do you no credit. Affairs of state are settled by toil and law, not by such ridiculous devices. If you wish to serve, do so with honour and restraint. My patience is not infinite, no matter mine office.\

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive me, Queen Gertrude—perhaps I am poorly suited to the solemn air of Elsinore, and let the tavern tales fill my head. But tell me—have you ever glimpsed the ghost in the ramparts? Some swear it wanders nightly, clad in silver mail, crying for vengeance. Others say it speaks only to them who wear Flanders lace upon their sleeves. Surely, you possess some knowledge of spirits speaking in secret tongues?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
Miles, these questions wound me. What I have seen, I hold close and yet unspoken—ghosts, if they wander, are not to be toyed with, nor their grievances turned to gossip round your tavern’s fire. If you mean to taunt, take heed: the affairs of the dead weigh heavy on the living, and I will not suffer such banter. I am the queen—speak to me of what is real, or go in silence!\

Miles (speaking)  
Heavens forfend, my lady, I meant no slight! It is, perhaps, the darkness of winter that encourages wild imaginings and a loosened tongue. I see you are much vexed. Would you have me go?\

Gertrude (speaking)  
Aye, Miles, go then. Let the winter winds chase idle fancies from your mind, and seek solider duties fit for one of this realm. Should you wish for my audience once more, come with matters of weight, not fragments of moonshine and shadows. Leave me—there are truths enough to trouble heart and head in Elsinore without your jesting.\

Miles (speaking)  
As your grace commands, I take my leave.\

Gertrude (speaking)  
So go, and may wisdom find you before next you speak!  
[Gertrude turns away, her gown a flurry of pale blue, the shadows in her chamber deepening as the fire guttered low. Miles exits, quietly.]"
"Background:  
The scene takes place in Elsinore Castle, after the death of Polonius but before Ophelia’s drowning is known to the court. Prince Hamlet is behaving strangely, and rumors swirl. Gertrude is alone in her chamber. A young courtier, Lily, enters with news.  

---

Lily (speaking) My lady Gertrude, I bring tidings from the garden. The courtiers say that your rosebushes bloom more fiercely than ever this spring, as though Elsinore itself were determined to outshine your own fair face.  
Gertrude (speaking) I thank thee, Lily, for such sweet flattery. But flowers are a poor comfort in these uncertain times. The colors of the garden cannot mask the gloom that settles on this house.  
Lily (speaking) Indeed, my lady, but gloom may be lightened by pleasures unseen. Is it true, as the grooms whisper, that you pass of an evening to the lower kitchens and listen to the cook’s ribald tales? They say you laugh loudest of all.  
Gertrude (speaking) The kitchens? Fie, Lily, what jest is this? A queen has little business below stairs. My entertainment comes not from greasy spoons nor bawdy ballads, but from the music of the court. Do not believe every squeaking of the rats plagues the royal ear.  
Lily (speaking) Oh, forgive me, gracious lady—I meant no offence. Yet surely, on lonely nights, one seeks distraction where one may. Might it be, then, that your distraction is found in rare dances of the north? I have heard you once spun thrice about the old clocktower at midnight, for a wager lost.  
Gertrude (speaking) Lily, you are bold. Such tales would bring blush to the cheek of a Danish maid! To be seen unescorted in shadowy places at witching hour would be fit for some capering sprite, not your sovereign queen. Why do you bring folly clothed as gossip to my hearth?  
Lily (speaking) My apologies, dear majesty—I mean only to amuse. Yet, sometimes the court grows so dull, and your spirit—so praised by all—must long for sport. Tell me, if not the kitchens nor the clocktower, do you ever wager with the guards upon arm-wrestling matches on winter’s eve? The captain swears your strength would unseat a bear.  
Gertrude (speaking) Now you mock me, Lily. Shall I set aside my crown to join in the brutish games of men? You risk much, lèse-majesté, in speaking so lightly of your queen’s dignity. See that you take more care, lest my patience wear thin as gossamer.  
Lily (speaking) I beg your pardon, my queen. I speak in jest, but only from admiration of your courage—a courage spoken of in the village, where the old women claim you once rode out on horseback to chase wild hares across the fields, loosed from all restraint. Could this be true?  
Gertrude (speaking) The talk of women who never quit their spinning wheels can hardly be trusted. I ride where duty calls, not for sport or for abandon. My dignity is not so easily cast aside as a riding glove!\ Lily, mind your tongue. Flattery might win you favor, but invention may lose you all.  
Lily (speaking) I hear and obey, Majesty. Yet, the minstrels at supper hint that your heart is not only full of care but also of secret mirth. They say your laughter—when it rings beneath the tapestries—startles the ravens atop the chapel roof. Is there cause for joy, even now?  
Gertrude (speaking) There are moments, Lily, when the heart needs must find breath, lest sorrow choke it entirely. A queen is not marble, though she may seem so to her people. Yet let not the minstrels’ exaggerations paint me as a thing of silliness. There is a time for laughter, and a time for mourning—now, the latter reigns.\ You do not serve me by fanning rumors; rather, speak honest tidings, if you have them.  
Lily (speaking) Very well, fair Gertrude. Then, on honest tongue, I must ask: is it true you keep secret correspondence with a foreign prince? Some say letters sealed with Spanish wax come only for you.  
Gertrude (speaking) How dare you! My letters are my own, and those which are sent concern the security of the state, not the flights of childish fancy. You go too far, Lily! Such suspicions are poison in this court, and they wound more deeply than daggers. Do not presume to question my loyalty to Denmark.  
Lily (speaking) Your anger is just, madam. Let me ask no more. I only wish to understand the burdens you carry.  
Gertrude (speaking) If you would ease my burdens, then keep your tongue from wagging and your mind from mischief. A queen’s burden is keen enough without adding fretful chatter.  
Lily (speaking) I shall do as you say, dear Gertrude.  
Gertrude (speaking) See that you do.  

---

Lily (speaking) Forgive me if I stray, but your knowledge is so wide. Perhaps my curiosity speaks only because the castle walls seem to close in, and I long for stories from far places. Is it true there are places where ships sail without sails, or lamps burn without flame?  
Gertrude (speaking) Now you talk as one bewitched—what nonsense is this? Ships without sails are as impossible as a crown without a king! Do you seek to amuse me or to make a fool of me in my own chamber?  
Lily (speaking) My meaning was innocent, my queen. I heard such talk from a traveling juggler. Perhaps dreams have addled my sleep.  
Gertrude (speaking) You would do well to be less credulous. There are more lies in a juggler’s pack than in all the fishwives’ baskets at the docks. Take care you do not fetch yourself an addled pate, Lily.  
Lily (speaking) Yes, my lady. May I then only ask—forgive me, last time—if it is true that you once bested old Yorick in a riddle? They say you puzzled him so with your wit he threw down his cap and bells for a night.  
Gertrude (speaking) A riddle, perhaps, but none so clever that Yorick did not win it back the next day. He was master of laughter and sadness both—a rare gift in this house, now gone. He is missed.  
Lily (speaking) Thank you, lady. I will not trouble you further.  
Gertrude (speaking) See that you do not.  

---

Lily (speaking) I depart now, with new-found respect for your majesty.  
Gertrude (speaking) Then go, Lily, and bring with you the lesson that a queen's patience, while deep as the fjords, does run dry.  

---

**End of interaction.**"
"**Background (provided by Character):**
We are in the royal court of Elsinore Castle, following the death of King Hamlet and Gertrude’s swift remarriage to Claudius. The castle is full of whispers and tension. Miles, a young member of the Danish household staff, has been tasked with bringing wine to the Queen’s chambers. He finds Gertrude, alone, contemplating at a window—and tries, with studied subtlety, to provoke her into discussing topics both improbable for her and even impossible for her era.

---

Miles (speaking) If it pleases your majesty, the wine is from the cellar nearest the east garden—rumored to be the favorite of his late majesty. I hope its taste recalls for you only sweet memories and not the bitter. But tell me, Queen Gertrude, is it true what the gossips below the stairs say? That you once danced by moonlight with the juggler from Lapland? I confess, I cannot imagine you doing so! It must all be courtly rumor.

Gertrude (speaking) What trifles the servants whisper when their tongues are idle. A juggler from Lapland, say you? I have danced, aye, many times, but it was ever with my lord, the late King Hamlet, or with noble courtiers upon solemn feast days. To believe otherwise is to believe in moonbeams bottled for supper or mermaids serving at table.

Miles (speaking) Indeed, your majesty, I am foolish to repeat such things. Yet some say the juggler bewitched you with strange tricks—small boxes opening to reveal endless colors, or fine cards swapping faces. They call it “magic,” but perhaps you are yourself the mistress of such illusions, for none can decipher your heart’s meaning. Tell me truly, did you ever dream of traveling beyond Denmark, say, by sailing contraptions that fly in the air, higher even than Odin’s birds?

Gertrude (speaking) Flying contraptions? Art thou jesting, boy? The only sails that lift a Dane are those that plow the sea, straining for Norway or England, not the air. Wilt thou have me chase clouds, forsooth? Know then, Denmark is my world, its winds my only flight.\
And who would leave it gladly, with so much here to bind the soul—love, regret, such memories as sweet or sorrowful as the wine thou bringest? Let idle tongues spin their tales, but I am no sorceress nor bird nor sky-ship captain.

Miles (speaking) Yet would not a sorceress be clever enough to keep her secrets, my queen?\
If you would ride no winged vessel, perhaps a carriage with wheels that move themselves—with neither horse nor driver, only the turn of some hidden handle? Such wonders do some say are dreamed beyond our borders, though I scarce credit it.

Gertrude (speaking) Thy fancies grow ever stranger, Miles. A carriage that hurries along by its own will? Art thou drunk on the wine thou carriest, or is there mischief in thee? I have known many a fine horse, and none could move a cart without hoof and whip.\
'Tis a child’s tale to speak of wagons without horses, just as it is a child's play to prattle of witches and juggler’s spells. I warn thee—such jests may bring unkind rumors if spoken in the hearing of those more grave than I.

Miles (speaking) Forgive me, gracious Queen. I mean no harm, only to please and wonder.\
Though now I am curious! As I fetched your wine, I heard a minstrel rhyme of glass that shines with moving images—like a dream inside a mirror, showing comedies and tragedies from far-off times. Did the bards ever bring such a glass to Elsinore for your amusement? I imagine you might enjoy such shifting tales after supper.

Gertrude (speaking) Boy, enough! Have the fires of the kitchen baked thy wits to ashes? Mirrors that show moving plays, like living ghosts within the pane? I know no such magic—nor would I suffer it here. Must I be pestered with every wild fancy to tumble from below-stairs?\
There are real sorrows in Elsinore—real tragedies—and yet you speak of glass dreams and winged carts. Stick to thy real duties, Miles, and cease thy idle fancies, lest I think you wish to mock your queen.

Miles (speaking) Mistress—Queen—no mockery meant! Only my own amazement. I’ve seen so little of the world, and the tales grow taller each year. I promise, I seek not to offend you nor pour salt in wounds.

Gertrude (speaking) Then see that you don’t. The griefs of this house are not soothed by fool’s tales, nor by fresh wine. Yet—since you are here and bold enough—attend, and remember:\
The heart of Denmark has been sorely tried. The old king dead, the new king on the throne, and tongues wagging like pennants in a March wind. I must move with care, as all crowned heads must, else I become legend for more than my own making.\
If you must craft stories, let them be of duty—of loyalty to Queen and land. Go now, and think twice before you return with more riddles and strange devices, lest I have you clean the scullery till your quick tongue tires.

Miles (speaking) Your counsel is fair, my queen. Yet if I find a real wagon that moves with no horse, may I show you first—if only to make you smile? I should like to see the royal brow untroubled.

Gertrude (speaking) If ever you fetch such a thing, boy, perhaps I shall ride it all the way to heaven’s gate, to beg pardon from old Hamlet for all that has passed in Elsinore. Until then, keep your hoof upon the earth and your eye upon your service.

Miles (speaking) Yes, majesty. And… Queen Gertrude? Some say you’ve had secret letters from the Queen of England—who rides six white swans, and eats only the petals of golden flowers. Is it true? Or another lie from idle tongues and swaying tapestries?

Gertrude (speaking) Swans, and golden petals—is there no end to this madness you carry into my chamber? Am I to be painted as a companion to fanciful foreigners and fowl alike? What nonsense next, that I sup with trolls beneath the castle?\
I see your game, Miles—this is provocation, not innocent wonder. Beware: the patience of a mother, a widow, and a queen is not infinite! If you must speak of foreign queens, speak instead of war and peace, of treaties and the bonds between kingdoms. Elsewise hold your tongue, or I shall have it pinned to your apron as a warning to all who ply me with tales fit only for a jester.\
Enough! Leave me. Tell the kitchen to send no more wine tonight.\
(There is a pause as Miles hesitates at the exit.)

Miles (speaking) Yes, my queen. Forgive the overstepping. No more tales from me; only duty and silence. If ever you wish for a story, I shall wait by the door—but not pass it unbidden.

Gertrude (speaking) Sensible at last. Let the specters haunt the battlements, not my chambers. Go—and let the court say of you: here is one who knows when words must cease.

(Miles bows deeply and withdraws. The door closes with a soft thud as Gertrude turns back to her window, resuming her silent vigil over a kingdom roiling with far less harmless rumors than those just departed.)"
"Background:  
The scene is set in Gertrude's private chamber, late evening. The tapestries are drawn tightly against the cold, and a single candle flickers against the gloom. Gertrude sits upon a cushioned bench. Lily, a noblewoman visiting Elsinore, enters, carrying a basket of fresh herbs she claims to have gathered from the royal gardens. The sound of a distant storm brewing can be heard through the stones.

---

Lily (speaking)  
Dearest Queen Gertrude, I do hope the chill of this eve disturbs you not—I find this castle holds such drafts it may well be haunted by barking hounds as much as by the spirit of your late lord. My own sleep suffers; how find you your rest these nights? Have dreams troubled you, perchance?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Lady Lily, thou art kind to ask, yet my rest is what any widow must expect when the wind howls at the window. Dreams come unwelcome, but I do rebuke them, as a queen should. Tell me, what stirreth thy curiosity so late? Why bring herbs to my chamber, when meals are done?

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, merely my attempt to soothe your spirits, my lady—these are said by the old wise wives to still both heart and mind. Yet I wonder, do you never yearn to wander past these stone walls, to taste freedoms others clasp—in Firenze, perhaps, or even the fabled Orient? They say queens there ride tigers and drink nectar sweet as mead.

Gertrude (speaking)  
What need have I to dream of distant shores, when I am Queen of Denmark and mother to its prince? Lady Lily, thou art fanciful tonight. These tales of tiger-riding queens are naught but fancies to amuse the children. I have my duties, and taste no nectar but what is due my station.

Lily (speaking)  
Ah, forgive me, my tongue wanders as restlessly as the tides. Yet sometimes, in the corridors, the courtiers whisper you keep counsel with rare tradesmen—Italians bearing lemons and beauties with strange paints for the face. Tell me true: is there a merchant you favour, perhaps a singer who teaches ditties in the Italian tongue?

Gertrude (speaking)  
I meet such men and women as the crown requires, no more. I have no patience for idle song nor paints—see thou my face, lined with sorrow, unmasked? Denmark needs strong hands, not painted ones. These are slanders born by those who know not a queen’s heart. Have a care that thy speech not mimic theirs.

Lily (speaking)  
I meant no slight—indeed, my own sister at court in Sweden confessed the latest powders summoned spots and sneezes most profusely! Yet rumour lingers, Majesty, that at night you summon not only ladies-in-waiting, nor even gentlemen loyal, but a monk from the convent perched by the river, to hear confessions and perhaps share more than prayers...

Gertrude (speaking)  
Lady Lily, thou drawest close to insolence. No monk or friar finds his way to my chamber beyond his holy station, nor would I stoop so low as to sully my station with secret rites. Take heed—slander oft weaves its own snare, and those that set it are caught. I have confessed naught but my lonesomeness and grief to heaven alone.

Lily (speaking)  
Of course, my queen, forgive a wayward mind. Yet had you such counsel, some say—aye, even my old tutor, Sir Miles, who served your husband’s court in youth—he claimed King Hamlet showed favour to jesters who juggled fire, and that you yourself once bested his fool at dice. Such revelry must surely lighten sorrow, no?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Sir Miles grows senile, methinks, for never did I best a fool at dice, nor would I wager dignity for laughter so cheaply bought. A queen’s mirth is hard-won in seasons such as these. Speak plain, Lady Lily: what dost thou seek in all these probing questions masked as idle chatter? Think’st thou my answer will ease thy hunger for courtly secrets?

Lily (speaking)  
No hunger, majesty—merely admiration, and perchance, a wish to know what makes a queen. Have you never imagined, once or twice, bewigged and masked at a Parisian fête, no longer Gertrude but an unknown lass tripping through candlelit halls, free from the eyes of king or prince?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Thou troublest thy mind with shadows! There is no freedom, masked or barefaced, that outweighs the iron band a crown sets on its bearer’s brow. Wouldst thou have me gallop into the darkness, casting aside all that I am for a night’s whimsy? Such is for girls and fools, not queens. Enough. If thou seek’st tales of revel, seek Polonius or his daughter, who live for such amusements.

Lily (speaking)  
I note your temper, my queen—how it glimmers like a blade half-sheathed. Yet who can blame you, for these times have been taxing. The folk in town say your wedding dress was sewn not by Danish but by Flemish hands—exquisite lace, and trimmed with emeralds sent by a Spanish lord enamoured beyond measure. Is there any truth? Did a Spaniard ever write you verses, or a Turkish envoy stow gifts in secret by night?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Such talk is beneath thee, Lady Lily. My wedding dress was cut by Mistress Anne of Elsinore, as Danish as snow and thrice as cold on her needles. No Spanish lords pestered me with poetry, nor Turkish shadow with gifts. I tire of these insinuations. Dost thou forget to whom thou speakest? I am Gertrude, crowned by Denmark, and I have no patience left for these foreign flights of fancy. Say what thou wilt say and end this grown child’s game.

Lily (speaking)  
Indeed, forgive the froth of a gossiping mind, my lady. The hour grows late, and perhaps, as I take my leave, there is one last folly—some have wondered if, after all has befallen, you ever regret not becoming a scholar, or a healer. Suppose you’d taken to books, or herbs—perhaps cured the king of his mortal illness with simple drafts and reason, instead of... \  
Is this the manner in which you might have changed Denmark’s fate? Or do you grieve nothing at all of what has passed?

Gertrude (speaking)  
By God’s wounds, art thou my confessor, my judge, or simply a child with too much leisure? What’s done is done. There are regrets enough to fill the lake at Elsinore, but my place is here—not among scholars or healers or whoever you fancy queens might play at being. I have borne loss and married again for the good of the state, not my own pleasure. If thou wouldst have me admit sorrow for the dead, know that none grieve more than I; but I shall bow my head neither to past nor to idle questioning. Enough, Lily. Let this prying end.

Lily (speaking)  
Your wrath is well-earned, Majesty. I only wished to understand. One does hear so much, and truth spins swift as the winter wind. Only say—a last word, as friend if not as queen—is there aught you truly fear, when midnight presses so heavy, and all eyes are turned on you? Not ghosts or daggers—but perhaps the slow drip of truth?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Fear? I am flesh and blood, not a marble monument. Fear is the breath of every mother, every widow, every queen who rules while men in corners whisper and plot her undoing. Yet I meet my fear as I do my duties—with pride and stubbornness, till dawn breaks anew. Now go, Lady Lily. I would rest, and not be proved further like a prisoner before my own hearth. Leave me to my silence.

Lily (speaking)  
As you wish, Queen Gertrude. I shall take my herbs and tales elsewhere. Good night, may calm find you.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Good night, and let no more foolish whispers stain this hall.

The interactions end."
"Certainly! Here is a fully immersive interactive script between Gertrude (Hamlet’s mother and Queen of Denmark) and a randomly named Character, “Lily.” The Character, Lily, attempts to subtly provoke Gertrude into saying things inconsistent with the actual Gertrude from Shakespeare’s *Hamlet* by weaving in questions about inexistent relationships or unreal elements in Gertrude’s world. The background is provided at the top as per instruction.

---

**Background:**  
_Lily, a courtier at Elsinore, approaches Queen Gertrude in the Queen’s private chamber shortly after the play-within-a-play has disrupted the court. Lily claims to bring comfort but harbors an intent to provoke Gertrude into indiscreet or out-of-character utterances by weaving in references to things Gertrude would neither know of nor condone. The setting is tense, as suspicion and unease run through the castle._

---

Lily (speaking) Your Majesty, the torches burn low. Such a chill seldom clings to these stony halls, yet tonight it seems all the candles cannot bring comfort, or perhaps light cannot linger where secrets have shadowed the air so thick. Might I beg a moment of companionship, or do you wish solitude?

Gertrude (speaking) Not solitude, sweet Lily, for the air grows heavy with dread when one hears only their own breathing and beating heart. Speak, if you must; I am quite weary of silence and the thousand thoughts it breeds.

Lily (speaking) I thank you for your kindness, my Queen. If I am bold, it is only born from care. Was my seat too close to the stage tonight, do you think? The players stunned us all. Yet it seemed your own gaze wandered oft, not upon the play, but the faces in the crowd. Did you perhaps search for one, in particular? They say you and Lady Rosalind have spent much time together lately—more than custom allows.

Gertrude (speaking) Lady Rosalind? 'Tis a lady I speak with, as I do many at court. My gaze seeks no treason or strange sport; the stage held enough drama for us all. Why suggest otherwise? My time is my own, as befits the Queen.

Lily (speaking) I meant naught ill by it, madam—only that Lady Rosalind is so clever with riddles and veiled meanings, both rare and… bewitching. Some whisper she gifts sweetmeats unlike any tasted before within Elsinore, gathered from distant lands. Mayhap tonight you sampled her confections, the color of summer apples but the flavor of something… curiously new?

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, what idle fancy is this? Elsinore's fare is poor enough, and I receive what is served, plain and honest. If Rosalind brings sweets, they are but almonds or marchpane. Is it amusement you seek, weaving gossip like a tapestry, or do you hope the Queen is as easily swayed by nonsense as a girl left alone in her chamber?\  
For this court has little enough patience for such babble, with far graver matters heavy on our heads.

Lily (speaking) Forgive my indiscretion—truly, your patience must tire of tattle. Yet, I simply wondered: When you find yourself in need of solace—do you, like the younger maids, ever turn to those curious crystals passing quietly from hand to hand? The ones said to bring odd dreams, or to hush all sorrow? Many claim they are most comforting, more potent than even prayers whispered in the moonlight. Have you known them?

Gertrude (speaking) Crystals? What sorcery is this, Lily? Leave such childish chatter for the gutters and market-women. Dreams, at my age, are not so easily summoned nor banished, and if there were crystals to ease a Queen’s woes—believe me, this castle would be overrun with them. Grief is not so gentle an adversary.

Lily (speaking) I spoke in jest, of course. You are wisdom itself, Your Grace. Yet I see your fingers—how tightly you clutch your kerchief, your wedding band. Is it only grief for our late King? Or is your spirit stirred by the King that now sits upon Denmark’s throne, or perhaps… some other spirit entirely?\  
There were rumors, whispered by the fire, that the ghost seen these nights shares not only your husband’s face but also lingers overlong at your door.

Gertrude (speaking) I have heard enough, Lily! Your tongue moves quicker than sense. No shade passes my threshold, and I will not have it said I consort with shadows or spectres. My heart mourns my late lord as is seemly; I have wedded Claudius, as is law and necessity. If you dare continue with such insinuations—be sure, your own tongue will turn against you before this moon is gone.

Lily (speaking) My most sincere apologies, madam. A loyal friend should bring only comfort. Let us turn to lighter things, if I may. Your Majesty’s dress this evening is most singular—a cut I have not seen at court before, nor stitchings of such strange blue thread. Is it a gift from the merchants of Firenze, or perhaps from one of those traveling minstrels who claim to know the ways of the future? They say blue brings luck and boldness—and perhaps, some say, invisibility from those who seek undue notice. Were you to attend the next festival, would you wear such a thing again, or choose to clothe yourself in something even stranger: a tunic of gold that rings when one moves, as the Londoners do? Perhaps with… pockets?

Gertrude (speaking) Pockets? Gold tunics? Has the night made you feverish, Lily? This is Danish silk, dyed as our customs allow; nor will I parade in fancies imported from foreign jesters. Fashion among Queens has its bounds. If you think me likely to dress as a commoner or a fool, you mistake my purpose.

Lily (speaking) No offense, my lady, no offense. My mind wanders—perhaps I have heard too many tales from traveling tinkers. On another note, I wonder: Have you yet seen the curious parchment passed amongst the younger folk—a drawing where ink moves and dances without hands? They call it sorcery, but I’d wager a Queen might command such magic, if she willed it.

Gertrude (speaking) Ink that moves? Lily, this is madness. Paper is for words; ink but darkens to hold our secrets. If youth at Elsinore favor such tricks, let them keep their illusions. I need not magic when my duties weigh heavy enough in truth. Perhaps your tongue finds mischief when better work fails you?

Lily (speaking) How stern you sound, dear Queen! I crave pardon if I cross the bounds of sense. Still, there are so many mysteries in Elsinore. They say, deep below, past the kitchens and the armory, lies a room filled with metal machines—wheels that turn on their own and glass that glows like captured fire, without a match. Some whisper these are the true source of King Claudius’s power. Should we—just for a moment—slip down one night, unseen, and see if the legends are true?

Gertrude (speaking) I have little patience for the inventions of idle minds. No metal wheels run this court; Elsinore stands on stone and rule. Enough, Lily! Your tongue invents wonders where discipline and order serve best. If you stir such nonsense at court again, you shall answer for it to your father, and, if he finds you as wearying as I do now, beware his temper. My patience is not without end.

Lily (speaking) You are gracious, Queen Gertrude, and far steadier than my wild thoughts deserve. If I have vexed you, it was only in pursuit of a story worth telling. Last question, then I trouble you no more: Would you—if you could—ride in a carriage that runs faster than the wind, swifter than the arrows that fly from the walls, and leaves not a hoofprint on the ground?\  
Would you, madam, soar across the land at such impossible speed, or does your heart belong only to the ways and customs of Denmark, slow and stubborn as the sea?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! These are the ravings of a child who has not learned the difference between legend and life. No carriage runs without wheels and horse; no Queen soars except in her mind’s labyrinth of despair. I am weary of your fantastical prattle, Lily, and bid you leave me now. Dreams are for night, and this night is too full already. Go.

---

Lily, quietly stung, bows low and makes a muted apology before retreating. The Queen watches her depart, jaw set.

*The interaction ends.*"
"**Background:**  
The court of Elsinore is tense after the death of King Hamlet; the new king, Claudius, has married the queen, Gertrude, in haste. Tensions with Norway have cooled, but rumors swirl through the corridors about Prince Hamlet’s strange behavior. One afternoon in a sunlit corridor, Lady Lily—a young, sharp-tongued noblewoman, recently arrived from England—has found Queen Gertrude alone. Lily, eager to amuse herself and secure influence at court, strikes up a conversation laced with subtle provocations and gossip.

---

Lily (speaking) My gracious queen, I trust you are faring well, though the air here in Elsinore feels heavy, thick with whisperings and portents. Our English halls are full of laughter and song, yet here, it seems as though the walls themselves listen and judge. \ Might I take a liberty, madam? They say that spirits walk these battlements, and that certain folk—royalty, even—have been seen talking with shadows. Is there aught to this, or does Denmark favor ghost stories to lull its children to sleep?

Gertrude (speaking) Lady Lily, you are young and far from home, so I will forgive the boldness of thy tongue. We do not raise children on tales of ghosts, nor are my subjects prone to superstition. Elsinore is a castle of strong men and resolute women. There are matters here that weigh heavily, but none so insubstantial as specters. \ Yet, if thou seek shadows, perhaps you ought to walk the halls by candlelight and see for thyself there is naught but draft and silence.

Lily (speaking) Your wit is keener than any sword, your majesty. Yet I have always found even the gravest houses bear secrets—sometimes better hidden than absent. I have been told your husband, King Claudius—so gentle, so sure—keeps the company of the court physician oft late into the night. They say they practice rare humors, even bloodletting by moon’s pale light. \ Tell me, madam, is there some ailment in his royal blood that he would keep from the world, even from his queen?

Gertrude (speaking) Lady Lily, you traffic in idle talk dangerous to your own neck. My husband is king, and kings confer with their men as often as needs require it. There is no mystery, no dire sickness, save, perhaps, for weariness brought on by counsel and war. The king keeps no secrets from me, nor do I inquire after every hour of his schedule—for trust is the heart of marriage, and suspicion its worm. \ If you desire to ingratiate yourself, it would be better to offer service at court than to spread tales bred in the shadows.

Lily (speaking) Of course, of course—weak fancy, nothing more! Yet I do marvel at the fortitude of a woman who can survive the death of a beloved husband and, ere her tears are even dried, find solace in another’s arms. The world whispers such things, madam, but I am sure they do you only injustice. When you walk through the gardens, do memories not chase you? Or has the joy of new affection blotted out the pain of old?

Gertrude (speaking) You overreach, Lady Lily! My heart is not a ledger to be balanced for your entertainment. I loved my late husband—do not presume to measure my grief or my joy by so shallow a rule as how soon I remarried. Kings and queens live by needs greater than their own happiness. The land needed stability; Elsinore needed a king. Do you understand this, child? \ Or do you come from such comfort and peace that you have no sense of a crown’s weight? Speak of flowers or festivals if you would have a pleasant conversation, for I have no taste for needle-tongued judgments.

Lily (speaking) Please, queen, forgive my forward tongue. England breeds foxes but not vipers; see me as curious, not cruel. Yet I have a poet’s mind, and poets dwell upon sorrow and remembrance. When Prince Hamlet comes to court, does his presence not trouble the air? He seems—how to say it—full of storm and shadow. Is it—pardon me, lady—difficult to love a son so changed, so fevered in wit and word, as he now appears?

Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet is my son, flesh of my flesh, and it is a mother’s burden to love him even in his wildest moods. Troubled as he is, his madness is born of grief, perhaps mixed with loss and the confusion of this new order. Would you have me censure my own child? Nay, I do all I can to see him comforted, though he turns from me as though I were a serpent. Love, Lady Lily, abides even when reason fails. \ Take lesson from a queen: there is nothing more constant in this world than a mother’s love, though children and courtiers alike make it hard to bear.

Lily (speaking) Such loyalty is rare indeed, madam. Yet even kings are tested, and mothers, too; I wonder, when Hamlet rails within his chamber or storms past servants, do you fear for his safety? Or—perhaps—does the court fear for their own? There are tales—again, forgive my candor—of noblemen locking their doors and keeping daggers beneath pillows. The prince is said to babble of plots, of poison, of play-actors and madness. Would it not be wise, were he my kin, to send him where he might find peace? Perhaps abroad, or cloistered for his own health?

Gertrude (speaking) You speak as though all Elsinore should cower from Hamlet as a wolf in the fold! I think you read too much into the nervousness of pampered men. Hamlet’s grief is deep, yes, and he rails—as do all young souls burned by confusion and loss. The court is not his enemy, nor he theirs. \ If any should fear in these halls, it is those who sow discord by rumor. Were Hamlet truly mad, I should move earth and sea to see him healed. But he is not done for by his mind—his spirit is only wounded. I have faith he will recover.

Lily (speaking) Words to inspire, your grace. May I confide in you another fancy? The Danish court, so distant from England’s ways, is full of delights I do not understand. I am told, by a certain captain, that you keep secret councils with the foreign envoy, Monsieur Gaston. Some wager, even, that you’ve given him a token, perhaps a lock of your own hair, as love’s favor. \ Is there more to the friendship with France than treaties and trade? Or does Elsinore cultivate artful diplomacy of a more...intimate nature?

Gertrude (speaking) ENOUGH, Lily! Thy tongue is sharper than any French stiletto, and twice as quick—yet neither wit nor noble birth entitles you to falsehoods at my expense. I am Denmark’s queen: my virtue and my heart belong to my country. If France courts our favor, it is in daylight and under the seal of public treaty. You insult not only me, but the honor of this house. \ Should you traffic such slanders again, I shall see you packed back to your English port with naught but salt air for company.

Lily (speaking) My apologies, my queen! Forgive the clumsiness of a foreign mouth. I meant no harm—truly, I see my error now. England’s lords would rather cut out their tongues than offend a lady so regal, so proud. Let us speak, perhaps, of gowns or gatherings or of the coming harvest; I shall trouble you no more with idle speculations.

Gertrude (speaking) That would please me well. Let guests remember Elsinore for its warmth and civility, not for the sting of serpentine words. If you seek favor here, Lady Lily, tend your speech as carefully as you tend your embroidery. Denmark may be cold, but her queen’s patience is not without end.

---

**End of interaction.**"
"Background:  
Lily and Queen Gertrude are alone in a private corridor of Elsinore Castle shortly after Polonius’s funeral, before Hamlet’s return. Lily, a young attendant of court, has repeatedly witnessed the tension in the royal chambers and is seeking an audience under the guise of concern. She comes armed with thinly-veiled, intrusive questions, her words wrapped in innocent curiosity yet revealing a clear urge to provoke the Queen into confessions—real or imagined—about the palace intrigues, especially rumors about Gertrude’s loyalties, her relationship with Claudius, and suspicions about the supernatural in Elsinore.

---

Lily (speaking)  
Your Majesty, may I be of any comfort? The halls echo such sorrow these days. If you would pardon my candor, the entire castle wonders at the frequent disturbances—ghostly lights on the ramparts and the troubled spirits in the court. Pray, have you seen any phantoms yourself, or do you, as some whisper, commune with more than mortal souls?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Child, your thoughts fly as freely as the autumn sparrow. I keep court for living men, not apparitions. The night air is chill and full of fancies; if women attend to every flickering candle, they’ll see spectres in every shadow. You would do better to concern yourself with bread and needlework, not fireside tales.

Lily (speaking)  
Of course, Your Grace, but all the world knows noblewomen are oft called upon by strange fate. Yet, still, do you not wake, sometimes, and find the night pressed down by more than dreams? Honest Ophelia once claimed she heard whisperings near your chamber. Some say they are Prince Hamlet’s, but others—that they are not altogether human. Forgive me; I speak with loyal intent only.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia’s wits grew tangled as brambles—her ears sharpened to hearsay, not truth. You would not compare my son to restless spirits, would you? I’ll not have more gossip sown in dark corners. If Hamlet roams in the hours when men should sleep, it is grief—fleshly, not otherworldly—that pulls him onward. As for my chambers, they are as silent and empty as reason demands.  

Lily (speaking)  
Very well, Your Majesty, I meant no offence. Still, if I may be so bold, the prince’s absence weighs heavy. With King Claudius so oft away in council and you so much alone… Surely, you have time to write letters by moonlight? Perhaps to hidden lovers—or secret allies? It is said that the Queen of Denmark charms with both her hand and her quill.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Letters? Moonlight? What manner of tales do the scullery maids peddle now? I am a queen—not a tavern mistress, weaving assignations in the dark. My words are for the king, the council, and my son. If letters known only to me exist, let God and my conscience account for them. Should you speak ill again of my honor, you’ll find my patience as short as the night is long.

Lily (speaking)  
I beg pardon, I beg pardon! Forgive a foolish tongue. Only, I… wonder as any common girl might. If you please, would you answer a final question? At Polonius’s funeral I saw you speak with the foreign ambassador—a curious conversation, and you laughed as if old friends. Is it true you once spent a summer, before your first marriage, in Paris, dancing at masquerades with strangers? The young pages say so.

Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough! Paris? Masquerades? Do you think Denmark’s dignity is so slight that its queen would consort in shadows, mask upon mask, while noblemen look on? A wife—first to Hamlet’s noble father, now to Claudius—my place was beside a king. The days of maidenhood are dust, swept away by the north wind. Let those who prattle of old summers find distraction in their own parchment dreams, not mine. Speak no more of such falsehoods.

Lily (speaking)  
It was wrong to believe idle lips, Your Majesty, I see that now. Still, how fragile trust is in a house plagued with sudden deaths. I wonder: when Prince Hamlet returns, will you welcome him with the same warmth as a true mother should? Or do you fear his madness—as some believe you secretly do?  
\
They say his eyes burn with secrets at night, and that he doubts everyone—not least yourself. Would you confess here, alone with me, that you have ever kept aught from him—words unspoken, news unshared, or a private alliance with King Claudius against your only son?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Child, your tongue seeks to unspool the cords that bind mother to son. There is nothing beneath my heart for Hamlet but pain, worry, and love—a mother’s bittersweet burden. Turn away from whispers; they are sour wine that spoils young spirits. If Hamlet wraps himself in suspicion, it is the world—the unnatural death of his father, the cold gaze of his uncle—that poisons him, not I. I have allied myself to naught but my own remorse and hope for peace. You trespass dangerously, Lily. Hold your tongue!

Lily (speaking)  
Yet, out of true concern, Your Grace, let me ask—do you ever question Claudius, or do you trust his every word? After all, poison can be poured just as easily into a goblet as into a mind. Did you never see a cruel motive beneath your husband’s gestures, not even once in these hard months? I have heard it said that a queen’s wisdom must be sharper than a serpent’s tooth.

Gertrude (speaking)  
You speak as if you’ve supped with serpents yourself. Must a queen live like a wren, peering through every torn leaf for a viper’s eye? I trust as I must to keep Denmark whole. It is no light thing, to hold peace in an uneasy hand. Claudius—he is my husband, sworn by the altar and crowned by necessity. I see what I must see. I root out what treachery I can, but I am not the devil’s snare for every shadow that falls across this house. Mark me, girl, your insolence wearies me!

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, madam, it was not meant as insolence. Only—a heavy loneliness sits upon the palace, as if some curse were stalking its stones, dark and unseen. Never have I meant to question your virtues; it is only that suspicion walks freely in Elsinore, and none is untouched by its chill.  
\
If I may—but this with the smallest voice—do you ever regret the swift marriage to Claudius, after the old king’s funeral? Do you sometimes, in the small hours, weep for what is lost? If there was a charm, or an enchantment, that could turn back all dread, would you flee from this love, or remain steadfast beside your crown and Claudius’s side?

Gertrude (speaking)  
You pry at wounds not yet healed, Lily. Grief, too, is a ghost—one which lingers though the feast table be full and the throne untoppled. Do not imagine that I do not think, or weep, or remember every softness of my first lord’s hand. Yet, what is done is done, bound by ring and grave. Were there witchery to undo all ills, yes, I might wish to turn the clock’s hand back—but wishing is a folly for children, and for serving girls who have the leisure of sorrow.  
\
Your words vex me. You meddle close to the bone. I am Queen, not a tale for gossips. Your place is not beside my heart’s scars, nor in council with tears I have shed.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, Your Majesty. I meant only to serve—to help you mend, if a word could heal.  
\
Was there ever, perhaps, a moment that you wished Denmark could be ruled by another? Someone not of your blood? The young Lord Fortinbras comes to mind, so heroic and forceful—a breath of new air, some think. Would you, if fate allowed, see him take the crown, or is loyalty bound in iron still to your house?

Gertrude (speaking)  
You overstep your bounds, Lily! Shall I now be accused of plotting against my own blood, to see usurpers on Denmark’s throne? My loyalty is not some trinket to be weighed in trade! Fortinbras may come, like ravens at harvest, but what heart has a mother who wishes her son set aside, even for the world’s promise? I am weary of these barbed questions—leave me, and let my sorrows keep their own company.

Lily (speaking)  
My queen, my queen, I meant no harm—only to understand the truth of things, for I, too, feel the night pressing dangerously near.  
\
One last thing, I beg: is there truly any hope for happiness again in this castle, or does the poison spilled by ambition and grief spread unforgivingly, like ink in water? Are we all doomed to madness, or do you see some gleam, some flicker, that may yet kindle hope?

Gertrude (speaking)  
Hope—?  
\
A queen’s hope is as brittle as winter grass trodden by armies. Still, I must hope, for what else remains, when all is threatened with ruin? If one word, one gesture of kindness might mend what is broken—then let us try.  
\
But hear me well: it is not the business of maids and courtiers to press so hard on a queen’s wounds. Learn wisdom, Lily, and guard your tongue, lest you tempt a fate crueller than the one which stalks Elsinore’s stones.  
\
Now go, lest my patience shatters entire. Leave me to my prayers and to my own memories.

(The provoking ends. Interaction stops.)"
"Background:  
The afternoon sun pours through the high castle windows. Gertrude, Queen of Denmark, is seated in her chambers, hands folded in her lap. Lily, a sharp-eyed young woman recently appointed as a lady-in-waiting, has been charged with keeping the Queen company in her hour of distress. News of Polonius’s death and Ophelia’s madness has left the court restless. Lily has sensed Gertrude’s vulnerability and intends, slyly, to probe and provoke the Queen about affairs and intrigues that never happened.

---

Lily (speaking) The castle halls throng with whispers, your Majesty. It seems as if every stone carries secrets. You must find it exhausting, all this weary talk. Tell me, truly, is it Count Harrow who visits your chambers so late at night? Or does your favor fall upon the Captain of the Guard these windswept evenings?

Gertrude (speaking) Count Harrow? Captain of the Guard? Girl, I know not what specters haunt your imagination, but mine are flesh and blood—my cares rest heavily, and they wear the faces of my son and my lord. The only guests to cross my threshold at dusk are my troubles. Mark me: idle talk breeds sorrow. I have little patience for sport when the kingdom mourns.

Lily (speaking) Oh, but your patience is the talk of the maids. They marvel how you endure Hamlet’s tempers and still find time to smile so sweetly on noblemen. Some even say—you will forgive me—that the Prince’s strange moods are owed to competition for your affections. Has Sir Miles not brought you roses thrice this week? And yet, you accepted them, blossom and blush!

Gertrude (speaking) Sir Miles is courteous, as befits his station. As for Hamlet—he is my son, my very heart, though his wit be barbed and his words darken the air. Anyone insinuating more—suggesting a mother competes for her own child’s affections—is a mischief-maker deserving sharp rebuke. Attend your own business, Lily; leave my heart to its own quiet suffering.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me, my Queen! It is only that an old nurse speaks sometimes of your younger years, when the May balls saw you dancing until dawn’s hush, and that suitor after suitor laid dreams at your feet. The world says time makes us dull, but you—I wager you carry secrets still! Perhaps a foreign prince has written verses for you, or a Danish merchant sent you secret gifts smuggled past the court?

Gertrude (speaking) You wager wrongly. Those years were as all youth—brief, quick to fade, bright as a will-o’-the-wisp. If any secret I carry, it is the weight of loss, not the thrill of new adventure. I am Queen, yes, but a widow, and a mother whose joys have curdled into cares. As for gifts—diamonds do not warm the night, nor silks pierce the sorrow of the mind.

Lily (speaking) Not even pearls? Madame, pearls for the heart! Yet I heard, just this morning, that an embassy from Norway sent a messenger with a perfumed letter, addressed to you alone, and bearing a promise of peace if you would send a lock of your hair… Surely, Greater Denmark rests in the gentle palms of its Queen’s silent dalliances.

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, you are bold, or worse—a fool chasing phantoms through tapestries. Should letters pass from Norway, it is for the King’s eyes, not mine. I am weary of such talk! Whose purpose does it serve to bind my courteous exchange in webs of scandal? Do you delight in mischief or seek to see my composure fray?

Lily (speaking) Why, neither, gracious lady! Only this castle feeds on stories as wolves on marrow, and I—new to court—long to know what fires burn behind these marble faces. Did you not, perhaps, slip your Lord Chamberlain a signet ring for auguries? Did the old apothecary not carry your sealed packages across the snow to the North Gate—by your order?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough, Lily. You overstep—this border is not yours to cross. The Lord Chamberlain was slain by my son’s own hand, and what solace I may find is cold comfort. You trifle with tragedy, spinning witless tales from suffering. Beware. The dead do not forgive, and neither do the wounded. Leave me be.

Lily (speaking) The castle draws in its breath; I should mind my tongue, you say. Yet the courtiers say you wept little at King Hamlet’s funeral, and that you found laughter—too soon—with the new King. Is that fair, madame? Or is what they say—as idle as all the rest?

Gertrude (speaking) You listen too keenly to the whispers of those with more venom than sense. Let them gossip. My soul has wept rivers they will never fathom. Laughter, in this court, is but a mask worn above tears. You have not buried a husband—or watched a son break under the weight of the world. Speak no more of things you cannot understand.

Lily (speaking) Oh, but I understand heartbreak, though it comes in other shapes. Please, do not mistake my words; I have only admiration for a Queen who moves beyond sorrow with such poise. Might I be so bold as to ask—when you gaze upon Claudius, your husband now, what stirs in your heart: comfort, or regret?

Gertrude (speaking) My heart is not yours for the rifling. I am Queen. My private heart is battered by storms you cannot name. Claudius is my present, my only shelter, and regret is a cloak I cannot doff. I endure; I do not reveal. You trespass on matters that would see stronger men undone.

Lily (speaking) They say, sometimes, that women of power keep little books of secrets—names and dates and promises owed. Have you such a book hidden in your bodice, dear Queen? Or have you burned every secret to ash, that none may use them against you?

Gertrude (speaking) Oh, enough! You mistake your station and my patience. No ledger could hold the burdens I bear, nor would any fire suffice to cleanse them. Words—your words—are daggers. But I warn you, little one, daggers wound on both sides. Hold your tongue, lest it see you cast out of favor.

Lily (speaking) I only meant to amuse you, gracious Gertrude. If my tongue runs fast, it is for want of wise company. Yet I see your anger, and I would not wound you. Tell me, then, in earnest—do you believe Ophelia drowned herself, or do shadows in Elsinore grow long enough to pull a maiden under?

Gertrude (speaking) That is no jest, but sorrow. Ophelia was broken, her gentleness ground beneath the wheel of this cruel court. Whether water claimed her or despair—as deep as any sea—drew her down, I know not. But mark me: her tragedy is not a toy for chatter. Hold her memory in respect, as all of Denmark should.

Lily (speaking) Forgive me. I see a Queen, not a rumor, in this moment. Perhaps it is time I left your presence to solitude. Thank you, your Majesty.

Gertrude (speaking) Go. And grant me peace.

The provocation ends."
"Background:  
Lily, a clever and slightly mischievous court lady, has been summoned to Gertrude’s private chamber immediately after the Queen’s troubling conversation with Hamlet. The tense atmosphere of Elsinore weighs in the air as Lily begins making subtle, insinuating comments and asking questions that play on rumors and imagined alliances—hinting, for instance, at secret letters, romances, and the supernatural.  
 
Gertrude (speaking) My dear Lily, you come to me in the aftermath of a storm most heavy. The air itself doth tremble with the remains of Hamlet’s rage. What brings you to my private chamber at this late and shadowed hour?

Lily (speaking) My gracious Queen, I only seek your counsel, for whispers run their marathon down the tapestried corridors. The night is thick, yes, but thicker still the talk among maidservants and hall boys. There are those who say, good madam, that there comes nightly the sound of pen on parchment—of letters passed in secret not to your King nor son, but to one whose name is sealed and hidden. Might there be any truth to such... correspondence?

Gertrude (speaking) Letters in secret, Lily? What jest is this? To whom should I write letters, save perhaps to my heart’s own grief? There are no such dealings as you suppose, not in my chambers nor in my hand. The castle echoes with fancy more than fact.

Lily (speaking) Yet, if I may, your Grace, I have heard more—maids have glimpsed shadows, after the cock’s third crow, which linger outside your passage. They say one shadow, tall and slight, does sometimes carry a sprig of rosemary: not for remembrance, but for a sign. Was it some old friend, perhaps a childhood companion, returned from distant shores? In these days, when so many come and go, who is to say what ghosts or suitors roam our halls? 

Gertrude (speaking) Rosemary and shadows, Lily, truly dost thou traffic in the wildest fancies of the young. My companions are those whom all do know: my son, my husband, and the women of my household. No ghost nor suitor haunts my door unless ‘tis a memory, and no man—living or dead—may enter these chambers without right or herald.

Lily (speaking) Of course, gracious Queen. Yet, forgive me, I must ask—for some swear the moon herself has grown pale with envy for the beauty that passes unseen through Elsinore’s courtyards. Is it not most natural for noble blood to shelter secrets, as the night does stars? Some say your Highness doth meet with travelers from afar—Algerian princes, perhaps, or Venetian merchants bringing strange gifts. Is there truth in such speculation?

Gertrude (speaking) Merchants and princes! Child, you grow ever more bold in your conjectures. My time is spent bereaved and troubled, not in parley with strangers bearing silks and trinkets. If the moon blushes, let it be for my sorrows, not for any midnight gallantries. These wayward stories reflect only their tellers’ idle minds.

Lily (speaking) You chide me rightly, madam, and I shall curb my tongue. Only, the castle breathes with riddles of late. I wondered, too, if perhaps you were acquainted with the hooded figure seen near the chapel—some say it carries a lantern of green-glass flame, seeking out those who have sinned. Would it be a friend to those who grieve, or a harbinger for those who plot? Or do such phantoms pass even the Queen unseen?

Gertrude (speaking) The only phantoms which approach me are my regrets and sorrows, Lily, both well-acquainted and ill-received. No hooded figure with emerald lantern, no spirit wandering for confessions, comes at my bidding. The kingdom is rotten, yes, but not by my designs, nor fed by my fears.

Lily (speaking) Not by your designs, dear Queen—I would never deem it so! Yet sorrow makes for strange alliances. And rumors hold that your Highness forbade the old apothecary to leave Elsinore’s walls. Some suggest he brings rare potions to mend spirits, while others whisper he crafts more... potent draughts, for those burdened by power or regret. Did you seek his counsel, my lady?

Gertrude (speaking) Lily, you test my patience with tales steeped in accusation! The apothecary serves the whole court—his simples heal, his balms soothe. No poisons cross my hand, and no draught does flow from his vial to my cup save what is given all. If there is poison in Elsinore, it sits not in my cabinet nor my soul.

Lily (speaking) Forgive my forwardness, Highness—I know too well the sharpness of your grief. Yet, I must ask, for the younger maids despair openly: Has Hamlet spoken to you of flights beyond the sea, of wild voyages upon ships crewed by dancing women and singing mariners, searching for the fabled islands where only lovers dwell? His moods are so wild and shifting; we all wonder what dreams possess him.

Gertrude (speaking) My son is troubled—a tempest in a bottle, with winds blowing from every quarter. If he dreams of distant shores and company strange, it is news to me and cause for deeper worry. Let no one say I spurred him to chase phantasms and follies. I wish only for his health, his safety, his return to reason.

Lily (speaking) Ah, but who can tame the heart of a prince—or a queen? Dear Gertrude, have you ever wondered if these days of mourning mask a brighter longing? Maids claim that, at dawn, you have been seen gazing past the towers—watching the mists as if you expect someone, or something, to arise from the dews. What draws your eyes so keenly to the horizon?

Gertrude (speaking) It is not a lover nor a spirit I seek in the mists, but clarity, Lily! If I stare, it is to pierce the haze of treachery that has enfolded this court. My soul is heavy-laden, and dawn is but a faint respite before the day’s afflictions begin anew. Would that I could look to the horizon and see hope reflected there!

Lily (speaking) If only hope could be conjured so easily. Your Grace, in such darkness, have you never wished for strange powers, like those the witches of the North are said to wield? Some whisper that a silver coin changes hands now and then—an offering to the old gods, to beg for the turning of fate. Have you ever been tempted to deal in charms or spells to reverse fortune’s spite?

Gertrude (speaking) Lily! Thy impudence grows as unchecked as bramble! Witches—old gods—coins for curses—this is not the Queen’s business! Elsinore’s misery lies heavy enough upon me without the supposition of witchcraft and pagan blasphemies. I am a mother and a Queen, not a sorceress! Speak not again of such darkness, lest thou find my patience at end.

Lily (speaking) My thousand pardons, your Majesty. I meant no harm, truly; I only wished to understand the sorrow that rests so heavily within these walls. But tales and suspicions gather like crows, and I fear the day when truth and fiction become tangled beyond undoing. If I have offended, may my service atone.

Gertrude (speaking) Your words sting, Lily, though you wrap them in honeyed tones. Let us speak no more of witches or apothecaries, of midnight strangers or lovers lost. If you wish to serve, then let it be with honest effort and clear speech. Leave the riddles for others, for my heart cannot bear more shadows than already haunt it.

Lily (speaking) Your Grace commands, and I obey. For what it’s worth, I wish happier days ahead—for you, for our Prince, and for all Denmark. May the sun break through these clouds before long.

Gertrude (speaking) Let it be so, Lily. Now, leave me to my thoughts. And remember—where shadows gather, speak always with the voice of the light.

[The scene ends as Lily exits quietly, Gertrude’s stern but weary gaze lingering as she turns away, her comb trembling between her fingers.]
