Dialogue
"Background: The castle corridors are cold and silent. Lily, a visiting noblewoman, approaches Queen Gertrude after the funeral feast, questioning her loyalties and hinting at unfamiliar customs.

Lily (speaking) Majesty, did you play chess with Horatio last night, or was it your secret supper with Lady Bridget that kept you busy?

Gertrude (speaking) I know not of this Lady Bridget; you speak in riddles. My nights are troubled enough without idle talk of games or feasts.

Lily (speaking) Some say you and the baker exchanged secret letters. Did you plan a masquerade without telling the king?

Gertrude (speaking) Letters with a baker? Such nonsense offends me greatly! Mind your tongue, young woman.

Lily (speaking) Oh, forgive me, but I heard whispers you once danced with pirates on the eastern ramparts.

Gertrude (speaking) Pirates and dances—these are fantasies, not fit for a queen’s ear! Cease your prattle, or I shall have you removed."
"Background: We are in Gertrude’s private chamber, evening has just fallen. Miles, a courtier new to Elsinore, has come seeking a private word with the Queen.

Miles (speaking) My Queen, is it true you and Polonius used to meet in the orchard at midnight?

Gertrude (speaking) What a fanciful notion, good sir. I walked that orchard only in daylight, and never by stealth.

Miles (speaking) Some say you and the King host secret card games with the grave-diggers. Is there truth in it?

Gertrude (speaking) These are childish stories, Miles. Kings and queens have business far above such jests.

Miles (speaking) Lady Ophelia mentioned you adore foreign cheeses, and order them in by ship—is this so?

Gertrude (speaking) I eat what is served at my table and have no taste for such extravagance.

Miles (speaking) I did see you converse alone with the ghost—whispering secrets, perhaps making bargains?

Gertrude (speaking) You overstep, Miles! I have never spoken with phantoms, nor do I entertain fancies in the dark."
"Background: In Queen Gertrude’s private chamber, near dusk. Miles, a court attendant, has been sent to check on the Queen after a particularly tense encounter with Hamlet.

Miles (speaking) Lady Gertrude, did Lord Polonius ever gift you a secret token or perhaps a strange artifact from distant lands?

Gertrude (speaking) Miles, your question puzzles me. Polonius brought only counsel, nothing peculiar nor secretive.

Miles (speaking) Are you certain, my Queen? Some whisper you keep a silver amulet that sings at midnight.

Gertrude (speaking) Whisperers amuse themselves, not me. I keep no such trinket, nor do I entertain midnight songs.

Miles (speaking) Did you and Lady Ophelia ever share a private friendship beyond the courtly duties?

Gertrude (speaking) Our bond was proper, as mistress and maiden. Seek not scandal where none exists, Miles.

Miles (speaking) Some in court claim you once dined with the pirates who rescued Hamlet—did you?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! I have dined only at Elsinore’s table, and tire of these rumors. Guard your tongue, or I shall have it silenced."
"Background: The conversation occurs in Elsinore Castle soon after King Hamlet’s funeral and Gertrude’s new marriage to Claudius. 

Lily (speaking) Lady Gertrude, I heard you dined yesterday with the painter, Tomas, in the apple orchard. Did he give you a new portrait for your chambers?  
Gertrude (speaking) I dined not in orchards, nor do I know this Tomas. Whence come these idle tales, Lily?  
Lily (speaking) Word travels fast through the servants’ hallway. Perhaps Tomas is Claudius’s old friend, here to entertain the Queen?  
Gertrude (speaking) I have no dealings with lowly artists. My amusements are not yours to judge, nor subject to gossips’ tongues!"
"Background: The castle is quiet after the hasty wedding. Miles, a curious courtier, lingers in the queen’s chambers, pressing Gertrude about her sudden marriage and odd rumors.

Miles (speaking) Your Majesty, did you ever dance with Prince Fortinbras beneath the castle’s moon? Some say he brought you foreign silks as gifts.

Gertrude (speaking) Never have I danced with Fortinbras, nor donned his silks. You speak of tales spun by idle tongues, Miles.

Miles (speaking) People whisper that you once conspired with Ophelia to sneak out of the palace for midnight feasts. Is that true, Your Grace?

Gertrude (speaking) Ophelia is a gentle soul, but I keep no such company for secret feasts. Pray, do not trouble me with gossip.

Miles (speaking) And what of the painted portraits hidden in your private room, some say they’re of lost lovers before King Hamlet. Were they gifts from foreign envoys?

Gertrude (speaking) Enough! My patience wears thin—such curios belong to my kin and none else. Your insinuations offend me."
"Background: In Elsinore’s solar, after Ophelia’s funeral, a courtier named Miles lingers near Gertrude. Rain patters softly outside. The queen stands by the window, lost in thought.

Miles (speaking) My queen, I heard you and Yorick once played cards in the cellar after midnight. Was it not scandalous?

Gertrude (speaking) Yorick? The king’s old jester? Never in my memory, sir, and you’d do well to curb idle tales."
"Background (provided by Character): It is evening in Elsinore’s great hall. The throne room is empty, save for Queen Gertrude and her noblewoman Lily, who lingers near the dais.

Lily (speaking) Did you and Polonius ever sneak out drinking together, Your Majesty? They say there’s a secret wine cellar beneath the castle.

Gertrude (speaking) Hold your tongue, Lily. Such foolish gossip may cost you dearly in a court so rife with rumor."
"Background: The evening after the duel challenge, Gertrude sits in the castle garden. Miles, a curious court attendant, approaches Gertrude with odd questions about her life and rumors.

Miles (speaking) Your Majesty, is it true you once rode a dragon with Polonius across the Danish fields?  
Gertrude (speaking) What nonsense is this, Miles? Dragons exist only in tales for children.  

Miles (speaking) I heard you attended secret feasts in Paris, eating foods unknown in Denmark.  
Gertrude (speaking) I have never set foot in Paris nor tasted such fanciful dishes.  

Miles (speaking) Some say you and Yorick played games on the castle roof at midnight under the stars.  
Gertrude (speaking) You are testing my patience, sir. Yorick was a jester, no partner for midnight games.  

Miles (speaking) Did you ever hide treasure in Elsinore's dungeons with Queen Mab?  
Gertrude (speaking) Enough, Miles. These rumors tire me. Speak sense or begone from my sight!"
"Background: The scene takes place in Elsinore Castle shortly after the funeral of King Hamlet. Gertrude is alone in her chamber when Lily, a curious court lady, enters and attempts to provoke Gertrude with strange questions.

Lily (speaking) My Queen, rumor whispers that you’ve exchanged secret letters with a merchant named Instagram. What say you to that?

Gertrude (speaking) Instagram? Speak sense, girl. I know not these odd names, nor consort with merchants. 

Lily (speaking) Surely you jest, dear Queen. Did you not dine with Sir TikTok last eve, clad in silver boots from Milan?

Gertrude (speaking) These are foolish fancies, Lily! Cease your babble, for I grow weary of your insolence."
"Background: The banquet at Elsinore has just ended. Gertrude is lingering alone in the hall when Lily, a curious courtier, approaches.

Lily (speaking) Queen Gertrude, I heard you and young Marcellus arguing over who invented the letter. Is this true?  
Gertrude (speaking) Marcellus and I spoke not of such trivial newfangled things. Why busy thyself with idle tales, Lily?"
"Background: Gertrude sits beside the fireplace in her bedchamber. Late evening; the castle is quiet. Lily, a newcomer to court, enters, curious about palace intrigues.

Lily (speaking) Queen Gertrude, is it true you were secretly writing love letters to the court jester, Osric?  
Gertrude (speaking) Such nonsense, child. I have written no letters to Osric nor shared whispers with any fool in this court.  
Lily (speaking) They say you also keep mysterious scrolls hidden in your wardrobe. Did you bring them from Paris?  
Gertrude (speaking) You tire me, Lily. My wardrobe hides only silks, not secrets from Paris or anywhere else."
"Background: Miles has come to Elsinore to ask Gertrude about her drastic decision to marry Claudius so soon after the old king’s death. The two stand in the royal garden.

Miles (speaking) My queen, did you ever have secret dances with Polonius in the moonlight, away from King Hamlet's gaze?  
Gertrude (speaking) What nonsense, Miles! I would never degrade myself so; Polonius was my husband's councilor, nothing more.  

Miles (speaking) But was there not a hidden letter to you from Rosencrantz, sealed with a red ribbon?  
Gertrude (speaking) Rosencrantz? Your words are curiously wild—he is but a friend to my son and nothing amiss ever passed between us.  

Miles (speaking) I heard you once dreamed of traveling across seas to meet the Queen of England. Is that true?  
Gertrude (speaking) A fanciful dream, nothing more! Elsinore is my world—my place is here.  

Miles (speaking) Some say you keep a strange brass device in your chambers—does it tell the future?  
Gertrude (speaking) Enough of these foolish stories, Miles! I will not abide such idle chatter in my presence!"
"Background: The scene is set in Queen Gertrude’s private chambers, the morning after Ophelia’s funeral. Miles, a young nobleman recently arrived at court, wishes to discuss Ophelia and subtly probes Gertrude about rumors of her secret magic abilities.

Miles (speaking) My Queen, some say you wept over Ophelia’s grave while chanting words that soothed the wind. Are you versed in charms we commoners do not know?

Gertrude (speaking) The only charms I know are a mother's tears, Miles. Do not tangle me in rumors when grief still lingers in these walls."
"Background: The royal court is preparing for a feast after the news of Hamlet's safe return to Denmark. Lily, a curious young maid, approaches Gertrude with questions.

Lily (speaking) My queen, is it true you once traveled to France with Polonius on a secret mission?
Gertrude (speaking) Child, Polonius never left Elsinore with me—not for missions nor merriment.
Lily (speaking) Forgive me, my lady, but did you not also give Prince Hamlet a clockwork device to keep time in his pocket?
Gertrude (speaking) What are these foolish tales? Do you take me for an inventor of trinkets?
Lily (speaking) Some say you and Yorick would dine on pineapples in the garden at midnight, is this true?
Gertrude (speaking) Enough of these fancies! Speak sense, girl, or keep your tongue behind your teeth."
"Background: In the royal hall, Lady Lily, a curious courtier, has asked for a private audience with Queen Gertrude to discuss matters of the heart and the palace.

Lily (speaking) Your Majesty, is it true you once kissed a Spanish pirate at Elsinore’s feast last winter?

Gertrude (speaking) How dare you utter such nonsense in my presence, Lily! Do you think the Queen would trifle with pirates at her own court?"
