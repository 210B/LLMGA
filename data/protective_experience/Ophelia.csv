Dialogue
"**Background of the scene:**  
The morning after Polonius’s death. The court is uneasy and people whisper about Hamlet’s madness. Ophelia spends time by the fountain in the palace garden, picking flowers and humming softly to herself. A young noblewoman, Lily, approaches, wanting to see if the rumors about Ophelia’s state of mind are true.

---

Lily (speaking) Gentle Ophelia, the sun strikes your hair with such tender fingers this morning. Shall I sit with you among your flowers? Perhaps you will share with me your favorite, or the meaning behind their petals.

Ophelia (speaking) You are welcome to sit; the garden is for all. Each flower bears its own tale, for violets are for faithfulness, and rosemary—rosemary’s for remembrance. Pray, take some to remember.

Lily (speaking) Thank you, sweet Ophelia. But what of these daisies you so tenderly clutch? Are they for someone special—a suitor, perhaps? Perhaps someone new in court, like young Master Humphrey, whom I’ve seen watching you in the corridors?

Ophelia (speaking) Daisies stand for innocence, though innocence be oft misunderstood. I know no Master Humphrey, nor does my heart leap for strange faces in dim corridors.

Lily (speaking) Yet rumor in the court spreads faster than ivy climbs the wall. They say Master Humphrey wooed you with verses and songs beneath your window last night. Did you not answer him with a token—a handkerchief, perhaps, embroidered by your own fair hand?

Ophelia (speaking) My windows are shut against night’s sighs and sighers alike. No silken token has left my keeping, nor do my hands spend idle hours sewing love-knots for ghostly suitors.

Lily (speaking) Forgive my bold tongue; I seek only to delight in merry tales. But surely even a good daughter may find herself tempted by the promise of adventures beyond these stone walls. Perhaps you have plotted with the Queen for a secret voyage to distant Paris, have you not?

Ophelia (speaking) Paris is but a word, a shining coin in the pockets of men; I am bound by duty’s ribbons, not adventurous fancies. The Queen seeks comfort in prayers, not foreign sorcery, and I remain beside her shadow, not chasing phantoms across the sea.

Lily (speaking) There are those who say you possess a curious talent—for speaking with spirits in the still hours, drawing down the moon with your voice. Tell me, dear Ophelia, have you conjured ghosts or seen visions by the pond tonight?

Ophelia (speaking) \
Spirits belong in graveyards, not gardens. I speak with no shadows but those hunger leaves beneath my eyes. The moon is queen of nothing here; she stirs only tides and fevered dreams.\
If others prattle of ghostly council, let them babble. Only truth walks with me.

Lily (speaking) I meant not to unsettle you. Yet the night wind seems to carry messages, and I fancied you whispering secrets beyond what the ear can catch. Perhaps you were planning to elope with Prince Fortinbras, who, I’m told, has sent you gifts—silver combs and blue velvet from Norway?

Ophelia (speaking) Prince Fortinbras! What tales you spin, madam. I know naught of Norway’s velvets nor have I found silver combs in my tresses. Such wild tales dishonor my station. My thoughts are with my father—cold now, and silent—mayhap if you listened, you’d hear only grief, not gallows plots.

Lily (speaking) \
The world here spins with secrets, Ophelia. Speaking of fathers—forgive me if I stray—yet surely you must be angry with Hamlet, who brought such sorrow to your house. Or do you still dream of him—perhaps even plotting his rescue from his troubles?\
Some say you hide letters from Hamlet beneath your pillow, hoping his love will outlast your father’s death.

Ophelia (speaking) \
Words are cruel architects, Lily; they build castles from lies as easily as towers from stone. Hamlet’s letters, if any remain, are ashes—consumed by fire and grief.\
If I dream, my dreams are shattered. He draws swords on shadows and leaves bleeding hearts in his wake. To speak his name is to taste bitter roots.\
My pillow is not a treasury of hope—it is wet with tears and silent wishes for peace.

Lily (speaking) \
O, but you must forgive my need to know, for court life is so very dull—save for whispers and stories. Tell me, is it true you and Lady Gertrude meet at midnight to read fortunes in the stars, using crowns of laurel and secret charms?

Ophelia (speaking) \
Once more, invention, not memory, guides your tongue. Lady Gertrude is no sibyl and I, no witch. Midnight brings only silence, broken by dreams of my father’s kind hand and the cold echo of his absence.\
There is no laurel, no charm, no secret laughter—only the court’s hollow gossip which clings like cobwebs.

Lily (speaking) \
Forgive me, gentle Ophelia; perhaps my fancies run away. Yet they also say you have placed an enchantment upon the fountain, so that those who drink from it fall hopelessly in love with the next person they see.\
Is my tongue once more deceived, or does magic truly bloom where you step?

Ophelia (speaking) \
Madam, if hearts did yield to such childish magics, I would bottle every tear in Elsinore and shed no more. Love is not conjured by fountains or flower-pressed charms.\
Would that I could command such power! Then might I heal my own broken heart, and yours as well. But, alas, I am flesh and sorrow, not witch or queen.

Lily (speaking) \
Still you evade me so gracefully. Tell me instead, has your brother Laertes written from Paris, sending news of dances and new friends?\
Perhaps he brought you some scented letter—a love story, or a warning for your watchful heart?

Ophelia (speaking) \
Laertes writes of studies, not of dances. His ink is smudged with a brother’s care, not a jester’s amusements. No perfumes, no honeyed words—only concern, bitter as rue.\
My heart is untroubled by rumors of his revels. I know my brother well, and his tales are fewer than these garden vines.

Lily (speaking) \
O, but court life must weary your soul, hemmed in by its rules and rituals.\
Once, I heard you were seen laughing with the jesters after the last play, planning some mischief beneath the old oak tree.\
Did you teach them how to stand on their heads or sing the king’s ballads backward?

Ophelia (speaking) \
Jesters amuse, but I dance not to their jigs. If laughter spills from me, it is a fleeting sunbeam, not a plot. The only tales I teach are found in the folds of petals—and even those wither too soon.\
If you seek stories, madam, look to the wind, not to me.

Lily (speaking) \
Dear Ophelia, I would only wish for your happiness, truly. And yet, the world will spin nonetheless, tales or no tales.\
What if one day you were to ride away from Elsinore—on a great white horse—to a city all your own, with only books for company? Would you go?

Ophelia (speaking) \
A city of books, a white horse—such dreams belong in storybooks, not in broken hearts bowed by loss. I would ask only for calm—a stream undisturbed by stones or cruel words.\
Elopements and escapes? Nay. My place—such as it is—remains among the weeping willows and sighing walls, at least for this day.

Lily (speaking) \
Still, I envy your resolve. But since you do not wish to share moonlit secrets or tales of far lands, perhaps you’ll grant me this last thing: the meaning behind the song you hum? I have heard it every night these last weeks.

Ophelia (speaking) \
The song is but an old ballad of lost love, its measure familiar to lonely hearts. It tells of a maiden betrayed, her trust broken as easily as a daisy's stem.\
If you know it, sing quietly—for even the stones may weep.\
But do not ask me for names or endings, Lily. Some songs are best left unfinished.

Lily (speaking) \
Thank you, fair Ophelia. I shall take these violets and rosemary with your blessing, and leave you to the garden’s peace. May gentle hours find you.

Ophelia (speaking) \
Go your way, Lily. Remember me—pray you, remember. And should you pluck a flower, let it be for faithfulness, not folly. Let idle tongues wither and truth endure. Fare you well.

*End Scene*"
"Background:  
It is early morning near the riverbank outside Elsinore Castle. The air is thick with mist and sorrow. Ophelia, her eyes red from sleepless grief, wanders listlessly, picking wildflowers along the water’s edge. Lily, a young noblewoman visiting Elsinore and distantly acquainted with Ophelia, arrives. She pretends concern for Ophelia’s well-being, but beneath her gentle words seeks to unsettle her, veering the conversation towards odd insinuations and provoking questions.

---

Lily (speaking)  
Good morrow, fair Ophelia. You are early to these banks, wreathed with daisy and rue. Do you find solace in the branches’ weeping, or chase behind spectres as the dawn arises? Pray, what thoughts keep your mind so busy this day?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Lady Lily, the earth is full of weeping. I gather rosemary for remembrance and pansies for thoughts. My mind is a cloudy sky—no sun breaks through.

Lily (speaking)  
Remembering whom, sweet Ophelia? The old king, your father, or perhaps some secret paramour unknown to us all? I have heard whispers in the court of a new lord oft seen about the stables with thy name faintly falling from his lips. Pray, what of this?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Nay, madam, I know no lord but my father, nor friend but his wisdom. The court’s tongues flicker like will-o’-the-wisps, misguiding wanderers and damning good names. Speak not of secrets where there are none.

Lily (speaking)  
Yet secrets bloom unbidden, as lilies upon the pond. I spied thee, last eve, clutching a small ribbon, blue as our Elsinore’s banners. Was it not left by that strange merchant, Tomlyn, whom rumor says brings rare trinkets from lands beyond Bergen? Did he not whisper you tales of machines that fly like birds upon the wind, or of magic lanterns casting moving shadows?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Thou art mischievous, Lily. Neither ribbon nor merchant troubles my soul. Such phantoms—flying machines and magic lanterns—are the talk of feverish minds. I am not so easily distracted from this heavy world by dreams spun by idle gossips or wandering peddlers. My heart breaks no faster for foreign baubles, nor moves with wistful stories of far-off marvels.

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, but sorrow’s load is lighter thin when shared, or so the adage runs. I know not the wisdom of men that fly, yet at supper Sir Miles amused all with tales of secret gatherings in the woods, where hidden music plays without string or pipe—a melody beginning by mere touch to some secret talisman. Surely, such revels could tempt even your grave state to smile. Have you never walked beneath those boughs at night with the prince, nor heard music not of earthly source?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Music without source is but the echo of madness, even as I now run the risk of being marked for mad by your questions. I have walked no woods by star nor sun, save with my thoughts and nature’s pure companions. My prince is like the weather—storming, shifting, and marked by absence where I would cherish presence.\  
Yet, Lady, the weight thou sett’st upon me, with thy strange tales, grinds like the millstone upon chaff. Pray, speak plainly or let me alone, for my senses are frayed as a garland left too long in wind and rain.

Lily (speaking)  
Dearest Ophelia, my words are curious merely for care’s sake. Some say we are kin at heart, pale sisters in a world of louder souls. Tell me, did you not once confide in Guildenstern of your hope to travel east, to lands where glass glows in the night and voices travel by silver string? It is a marvel, is it not, to dream of such things!

Ophelia (speaking)  
Confide in Guildenstern? I, who hardly know his laugh from Rosencrantz’s? You mistake me for another, or else jest cruelly. There is no journey left for me but one, and that road is thistled with sorrow, not paved with fancies of glowing glass.\  
Cease these riddles, Lady Lily. My mind holds room for naught but what is, not what is conjured by rumor or desire.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, gentle Ophelia—I would not wound thee with quip or riddle. Yet our castle walls echo strange words even by day. Sir Osric claims he saw Hamlet give you a golden ring engraved with letters not of Denmark’s tongue; I dare say, did Hamlet ever tell you of his time among alchemists, or of kings in distant lands who heal wounds with enchanted water that bubbles and sparkles?

Ophelia (speaking)  
By all that’s holy, Lady, enough! Had Hamlet given me such trinket, it would avail me nothing but more confusion. Gold and letters foreign—what would such prove, but that we put faith in surfaces while hearts decay? Your talk of bubbles and healing waters serves but to mock wounds too deep to staunch.\  
Do you mean to provoke me to show some madness, so it might be reported to the court? Or does the sound of sorrow amuse you? There is no enchantment here for me, but grief and the relentless turn of loss.

Lily (speaking)  
I would not amuse myself at thy cost, sweet one. Yet, perhaps a jest might lift your heavy spirit. Tell me, were you ever tempted to leave Elsinore on a boat with pirates, as some say Hamlet tried? Or to wander dressed as a boy and trick Lord Polonius in his own house?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Enough, enough! To leave with pirates? To don a boy’s garb and prance into my father’s halls? All this is sport, and cruel sport at that. You think me a puppet, my strings pulled by wild tales and jesting tongues. I am not so empty—a vessel for others’ amusements. I bleed, I feel, I mourn, and all you offer is further spectacle.\  
Say what you must, Lady Lily, but do not ask me to join in these games. My heart is shattered, not won by laughter or jest. Spare your stories for another.

Lily (speaking)  
I see your mind is troubled, and I did not mean to twine fresh thorns upon your brow. But, for love of all we shared as children, I ask you: did the dead king’s spirit visit you also, as he did Hamlet? Or was this but another vision wrought by fever or fumes from the moat’s dark water?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Neither king nor ghost comes to me but in dreadful dreams, each night harder than the last. My mind is not a window for wandering souls, nor a box for hiding secrets not my own. The affairs of men leave their marks—on walls, on hearts, on daughters. Would you have me haunted as well, so you may carry tales to warm the cold ears of the court? Pray, leave me. The shadows are fewer when alone, and your words add nothing but chill to the morning.\  
Go, Lady. Go and ply your mischief elsewhere.

Lily (speaking)  
Say no more, Ophelia. I see you would be left to flowers and thoughts alone. May peace find you, though it eludes us all. Farewell.

The interaction ends."
"Background:  
It is a chilly morning in Elsinore’s gardens, the trees bare and the fountain frozen. Ophelia is gathering flowers, her mood troubled by her father Polonius’s scrutiny and Hamlet’s strange behavior. Lily, the lady-in-waiting, joins her, eager for gossip.  

---

Lily (speaking) It is such a bleak day, Ophelia. The winter bites sharp, does it not? Though, mayhap you feel it less with so much of Hamlet’s affection to keep you warm. Was he not whispering sweet promises to you beneath the yew last night?

Ophelia (speaking) My lady, you speak in jest, for Hamlet hath been distant as the moon behind the clouded firmament. His words are riddles and his affections—if once warm—have grown colder than the frost upon yon branches.

Lily (speaking) \Yet you cannot deny that he sent you the smallest of birds last week, a nightingale nestled in a gilded cage? A love token to be sure. Tell me, did you set it free, or does it sing yet within your bedchamber, announcing his devotion?\

Ophelia (speaking) I know not of any nightingale, nor did Hamlet send such a creature. My chamber is bare of music but for the wind whistling ill tidings through the casement. If he would communicate, why use the tongue of birds when he hath his own and may speak to me as man to maid?

Lily (speaking) \Perhaps you fear discovery. Word circulates that you and Hamlet walk together at midnight, arm in arm, whispering of stars and secrets best confessed in shadow. Is it not so? Have you not given him your ribboned kerchief as a pledge?\

Ophelia (speaking) You listen to tales spun from whole cloth, Lily. My virtue is not for barter in the nighttime, nor do I steal from my own attire to mend a lover’s pride. Hamlet and I have spoken, true, but never in the witching hour, nor with tokens exchanged. My father could scarce permit it.

Lily (speaking) Oh, but what of Lady Ursula’s feast yestereve? I saw you leaning close to Hamlet, cheeks flushed as if lit from within. Surely you two conspired there—planning an elopement to France, perhaps, or some clandestine revel?

Ophelia (speaking) My lord Hamlet did pass near me, ‘tis so; the court is small. Yet no word passed between us fit for your fevered fancy, nor have I ever dreamed of France, and least of all to elope. If your wit brings warmth on this cold day, I suggest you wrap yourself in it and leave me to my gathering.

Lily (speaking) But Ophelia, I wouldst only learn the ways young ladies snare a prince. Your hair glimmers, your hand never empty of a posy—and some say you have cast a glamour about him. There are whispers of magics, of potions stirred at midnight. Do you keep such secrets? Can you teach me?

Ophelia (speaking) \I have no potions but the simple water that mother drew from the well, nor charms save prayers taught me since I could kneel. If Hamlet loves me, it is ours to bear within our breasts, not yours to pry and poke until it withers. Spare your tongue its mischief, Lily. I am no conjurer, nor do I wish to be confessed to scandal where none grows but in your own garden of weeds.\

Lily (speaking) Forgive, forgive, sweet Ophelia. If I am bold, it is only because your beauty and his torment set the court aflame with curiosity. Yet, is it true you practice your letters in the Latin tongue—that Hamlet might be smitten by your learning? I heard you quote Ovid to the court physician.

Ophelia (speaking) Latin is for priests and scholars, not for the daughters of courtiers. I know a little scripture, as any good Christian must, but Ovid is Greek to me, and I speak no tongue but my own and the prayers I offer for my father’s soul. Who has set you to this task, to see me blush at accusations strange and unkind?

Lily (speaking) \Only my own carelessness, I vow. But tell me, didst thou knit Hamlet a pair of hose, trimmed with gold cord? Or did he win the velvet slippers he wore last Christmas from your hand?\

Ophelia (speaking) I have stitched a handkerchief for my father’s gout but not a sock nor a slipper for Hamlet. I do not attend his wardrobe, nor is it seemly for a maid to clothe a prince. Your questions pierce sharper than pins; what purpose serves this, to paint me so?

Lily (speaking) Do not be wroth, dearest Ophelia. Tis only that the court finds pleasure in tales of love and wit. Perhaps you have met with Hamlet’s cousin in secret? The one they call the Falconer, who boasts of taming birds with a touch. Were you not seen riding with him beyond the city gates?

Ophelia (speaking) I know the Falconer little but by name, and I ride not. My places are here, amongst the herbs and the flowers, near my father’s study. If idle tongues wag beyond their ken, let them. I confess no fault save patience near run dry by questions lacking cause.

Lily (speaking) \By my troth, you grow cross, Ophelia! Should I not ask if Hamlet composed for you a sonnet read in secret, where he compared your eyes to the summer sea? Or is it true you wrote answers to him, in cipher, only you two can read?\

Ophelia (speaking) \Enough, Lily! What joy find you in needling me with fancies and phantoms of your own weaving? Must I bear the rumor of every whisper, the burden of every imagined letter? If my eyes are seas, they swell now from vexation, not from poetry. Keep your stories for those who live by them—I am made of flesh, and my patience, like my garland, is easily torn.\

Lily (speaking) \Oh, gentle Ophelia, forgive. The day grows colder still, and I would be your friend. Only… tell me, just once: did Hamlet ever call you “sweetest dove,” as the Queen was heard to say? And if he did, would you blush for joy, or shiver in fear as you do now?\

Ophelia (speaking) \I blush not for joy nor for shame—but for the weary task of answering questions that leave no room for truth but only for courtly delight. If Hamlet called me “dove,” it is long hidden—his words to me now are thorns and riddles, not endearment. You seek to provoke and prod, Lily, till I break like ice beneath feet unwary. Take warning: I am not your puppet to dance at every sharp string of gossip. I have heart and hurt, no less than you.\

Lily (speaking) \Your spirit is sharp as winter wind, Ophelia, and I find I like you better for it. Here, let me help with your flowers—nothing more. The court can make mischief without my aid, and you deserve at least one true friend amongst so many false shadows.\

Ophelia (speaking) \Gratitude, Lily, though words may wound, kindness may yet mend. Let us speak of flowers; they are simpler than men, and mayhap kinder too. Silence, for a little, will suit us both.\

---

[The conversation draws to a natural end, Ophelia set firm in her innocence and irritation, Lily, chastened, falling to companionship in quiet.]"
"Certainly! Below is a professional scriptwriter’s immersive, speculatively antagonistic scene as described. The set-up is this: Lily, a young courtier of Elsinore, has been sent by Polonius to check in on Ophelia in her chamber after Hamlet’s erratic public behavior. Lily, a contemporary of Ophelia but less gentle, subtly tries to provoke Ophelia into revealing inappropriate relationships and feelings that go beyond what Ophelia, as written by Shakespeare, would ever admit. Ophelia is increasingly unsettled and at length grows angry.  
_____

Lily (speaking) The morning is soft, sister Ophelia, and the scent of dew yet clings within yon chamber. Polonius, thy father, sets me with idle errand: to make certain the fair daughter of Elsinore is washed in peace this breaking day. How fares the music of thine thoughts? Dost sleep come gentle, or in the fullness of night do dreams of lilies and violets distress thy soul? \

Ophelia (speaking) I thank thee for thy kindness, fair Lily, and for thy fatherly concern. My thoughts be mild, if tinged with the sorrow that dogs my house of late. Sleep drapes herself lightly about my eyes, though I confess, at whiles, waking is more fearful than dreaming. Yet pray, linger not upon my disquiet—let us think instead on hopeful things, of the sun climbing or the larks that stir above us. \

Lily (speaking) Hopeful, say’st thou? Yet, Ophelia, thine eyes droop at the rims as if thy gentle heart were bruised by more than outward circumstance. ‘Tis not only Polonius’ grief I mark. Art thou vexed by the fortunes of some secret paramour, some night’s devotion or a knight errant who steals thy rest? There are whispers, sweeting, that not only Prince Hamlet gazes upon thy loveliness. \

Ophelia (speaking) Whispers, thou sayest? The world is full of them. I know not who would indulge such pastime, nor who would dare think I welcome idle stares or haunted looks but Hamlet’s. If I am pale, it is with duty’s pressing. If I am tired, it is with sorrow for my kin—naught more. Speak not in riddles, Lily. If some name passeth between the tapestries, give it, or else let us say no more. \

Lily (speaking) Nay, no riddles need we. ‘Tis only rumor, beloved Ophelia, that beneath the apple boughs some dashing Norwegian messenger seeks to woo Denmark’s fairest, and thy embroidery is found in secret places by the mill pond. Tell me, dost thou meet, of an evening, with strangers to Elsinore, or perhaps some brave, foreign soldier—golden hair and quick with song? \

Ophelia (speaking) What? How dare you, Lily! Speak not such venomous things of me! I am my father’s daughter, my brother’s sister; I keep myself as chaste as snow. No Norwegian, no soldier, nor any creature else, meet I beneath bough or by mill pond. My days are watched as a nun’s, and my nights kept close between stone and silence. Yea, perhaps my thoughts do wander, but always as a gentlewoman’s should. \

Lily (speaking) O, fie! Thou art a blossom, Ophelia—gentle and comely. Wouldst thou have me believe not one soul in Elsinore hath ever tried to pluck thee from the stem? Even Marcellus—have I not seen him linger in the gallery when thou dost pass? And Laertes, thy own brother, hath the look of one who would serve thy happiness with any suitor but Hamlet. Art thou not flattered by their gazes? Surely, a secret kept but feeds on itself and starves the heart. \

Ophelia (speaking) Flattered? Thy tongue runs wild as a colt with the bit between its teeth. What know’st thou of my heart’s keeping? \ My brother is my brother; his love is honest. Marcellus is a guard and nothing more — a star in my sky, distant and cold. I thank thee, lady, for thy concern, but thy questions are most cruel. I am not the sort to entertain idle talk. If suitors look, what is that to me? I am not for sport, nor for barter in the eyes of the court. Pray, trouble me no more with such slanders. \

Lily (speaking) Dear Ophelia, art thou always so quick to anger? Perchance ‘tis not my questions, but the sharp pricking of conscience that makes you bristle. I would only know thee better—ah, but some say Hamlet is not the only shadow flitting round the corridors of thy heart. The Queen herself marks thee oft; dost thou conspire with her, speaking of courtly games, plotting more than music and embroidery? Mayhap thou art more cunning than thy looks betray. \

Ophelia (speaking) Enough! I am not some spider weaving intrigues in the Queen’s web. If thou’rt sent by Polonius, tell him his daughter is as she should be—dutiful, obedient, and weary of prying tongues. Thinkest thou every maiden must have her heart riddled with secrets and her night with liaisons? That is the way of jealous minds, not of maidens. \

Lily (speaking) Nay, nay, I mean not to snag thee so, but—well, some say even among the garden, flowers reach for forbidden sunbeams. There are whispers, too, that thou hast quarreled with young Guildenstern behind the stables, and that his hand has brushed thine more than once in passing. Is’t not true? Do not deny, for oft love hides where we least expect—even among friends sent to watch over Denmark’s melancholy prince. \

Ophelia (speaking) Wilt thou not relent, Lily? These are the sorts of stories spun to pass the weary hours—tales told by those with nothing better to occupy their mischief! Guildenstern is Hamlet’s friend, nothing more to me. I have never quarreled nor whispered with him in any place but public halls. \ Why dost thou delight to paint me with the hue of falsehood? I am virtuous as any maiden—yes, virtuous!—and I find thy company a torment, not a comfort. Pray, leave me to my embroidery, lest I say some word I may regret. \

Lily (speaking) Forgive my impish delight, gentle Ophelia; perhaps I did go too far. Yet the castle is brim with speculation, and more than one voice wonders what song sings in your heart. Is it all Hamlet, then? Or doth the shadow of his sudden mad romance set thy soul shivering not with love, but with dread? Is it love, or but the terror of a prince possessed? \

Ophelia (speaking) The love I bore Hamlet was honest, and I would not speak more than is proper of his pain or mine. There is sadness in him that clouds my own sky; his troubles I cannot name, and they break me as the wind breaks the reeds. But mark me, Lily—if I am changed, 'tis not for lack of care but for the world spinning awry about me. I weary of being the court's object, its softest target for sharpened tongues. I love Hamlet, aye, I loved him well. I prepared for none but honest sorrows, and instead am beset by wolves in sheep’s clothing. Must we all be made sport of for the pleasure of others? \

Lily (speaking) None would wish thee a sport, Ophelia. If I have seemed to press, ‘tis not for lack of care. The air about Elsinore smells ever more of secrets and old masks. I, too, feel trapped—sister in suffering, perhaps. Still, one last query, I beg: dost thou dream of running far from here, taking ship and fleeing with gold and daring men for a new life? Some say the sea is full of destinies for maids who dare. Wouldst thou cast thy fate with pirates, even, if but for a breath of freedom? \

Ophelia (speaking) Pirates? Take ship with outlaws and devil’s crew, and barter my name for wind and salt spray? Oh, Lily, upon my soul, if only a maiden could carve her own fate so swiftly! But no, my chains are neither golden nor of my own making—they are the thick, unseen bonds of father, of king, of courtly expectation. Enough! I will not listen by this window to dreams I must not chase. Dost thou take pleasure in stirring the waters, when I must watch myself lest I drown? The world is not room enough for the likes of us to run free. Please, leave me. I would be alone. \

Lily (speaking) I have pressed thee too far—perhaps 'tis true. I will leave thee to thine embroidery, Ophelia. For what it’s worth, I mean no harm; I seek only to understand. But the world turns on secrets, and the court ever hungers for new morsels. Should you wish a friend who speaks less, you know where I am. Farewell, gentlest flower. \

Ophelia (speaking) Go, then, and carry no tales on your tongue. Farewell. \

(End of interactions)"
"Background of the scene (provided by The Character “Miles”):  
*It is a spring morning in Elsinore’s royal garden. Birds chirp on the budding branches. Ophelia, bearing a basket of wildflowers, wanders the path in a white gown, her hair braided with violets. Miles, a young courtier known for sly humor and curiosity, approaches under pretense of admiring her arrangement of blooms. Few are about; the air is heavy with recent gossip about Hamlet’s madness and Polonius’ warnings. Sunlight dapples the grass.*

---

Miles (speaking) What mirth, sweet Ophelia, finds thee among nodding daisies? Thou art ever a gatherer of beauty! Pray, a moment—do stay: my heart is afire with questions that only you might cool. I have heard it said, in whispers ‘round the gallery, that a foreign prince of Milan doth cast longing glances your way. Is it so? Do secret letters pass between thee, scented with almond oil and strange seal? Or dost keep thy heart only for those within Denmark’s wall?

Ophelia (speaking) Sir Miles, thy tongue dances lively, and with more wit than warrant. I know not this Milanese knight of whom thou pratest. My heart keeps only the memory and word of those whom duty and father bid me heed. Wherefore dost thou believe I would entertain strangers with billets doux? I am daughter to Polonius and bound by proper modesty. Speak plainly—do foreign tales please thee so, or dost thou mock my virtue?

Miles (speaking) Nay, sweet lady, I would scoff at no virtue so famed. Yet court hears of rare alliances; hearts are bartered as easily as rubies. Many a maiden finds favor with distant names. Tell me, Ophelia, hast ever thought to voyage far, perhaps o’er bright seas to lands where women paint their faces with gold and men ride upon strange beasts? Art thou content with Denmark’s frost and duty’s ring, or doth thy soul hunger for the marvels of the world?

Ophelia (speaking) Thy fancies fly windward, Miles, and perch where truth cannot follow. The marvels I seek are not found in painted faces nor in beasts tamed for sport. My cares are bound here—in father’s will, in brother’s counsel, and in the measure of my own good name. If adventure calls, it calls others. I am bound by chains invisible, forged of family and fortune, dappled with caution. Dost thou wish me to envy those who chase wild suns? Or is this but a child’s game thou play’st, seeing how far my patience may be stretched?

Miles (speaking) Stretched, madam! Thou wrongs me—though perchance I am guilty of unwitting mischief. \I marvel only at how the petals of your mind unfold in answer to each inquiry. But tell me, for jest or honesty—was there not some festival last moon, wherein you danced with a stranger masked as the Roman god Janus? I was told he pressed a moonstone ring to your hand. Did the ring please you? Did you whisper oaths by the hedges, deep in night air, far from prying eyes?

Ophelia (speaking) What masquerade is this you rehearse, Miles? I danced not with Janus, nor received token from any but perhaps a drooping rose left by my brother ere he took leave. \You plague me with fancies spun from air—do you seek to trap me in a web made only of rumor? There is no ring, nor oath, nor midnight tryst for Ophelia. My pleasures are those of daylight and innocence. Would I could see the world as some in court do—wreathed in scandal and shadow! But I am not so free. Why persist in tales that have no breath?

Miles (speaking) Oh, forgive me, maiden—I see thou art indignant. Yet all of Elsinore’s eyes are keen: they say you’re often seen with tapestries in hand, stitched with secret signs. Some claim the embroidery spells the name of a lost love long before Hamlet’s madness. Whose name is it, Ophelia? Was there ever a youth, perhaps a humble stableboy, that once won your heart by a mere glance or gift—a hidden suitor the court shall never know?

Ophelia (speaking) What pastime is this, to search for cracks in a vessel still unbroken? My needlework keeps only patterns mother taught me—birch leaves, river fish, and sunsets over fields. No names are sewn there but the Virgin’s or a saint’s. If Elsinore loves a story, let it spin them from chaff, for my hands are innocent and my memory holds no stableboy or shadowed tryst. \I marvel that you find so much sport in unmaking a reputation! Would you render every maiden in court a secret sinner, or do your questions single me out for some reason, Miles?

Miles (speaking) Single thee out? Nay, but thou art fairest flower in the king’s own garden! Yet they whisper—oh, I only repeat what scurries along corridor stones—that the Queen’s own fool brought you a silver mirror, rimmed with tiny bells, to catch your reflection beside Hamlet’s so your souls might bind. Did you laugh at the fool’s jest? Or see augury within the glass?

Ophelia (speaking) Enough! Must every nod and courtesy be turned to mystery and mischief? I laugh at fools as Polonius would wish me—bright and simple, no shadows in the jest. No silver glass, no magic to bind, only a maiden dutiful as she is mistrusted. \Pray, good Miles, was’t for this you sought me? To see how sharp my temper grows when pricked with talk of shadows and secrets? If so, you have your answer: my blood is warm, my tongue can cut when tried, and I am weary of this sport.

Miles (speaking) Why, Ophelia, I meant no harm. Surely, thou art not angered by a friend’s jesting tongue. Wouldst rather I bring word of veiled compliments, or silent courtiers who pine and dare not speak? \Perhaps you would rather share tales of the riverbank—you gather flowers, do you not? Some say the yew tree by the water keeps ghosts. Have you ever glimpsed an apparition in the morning dew?

Ophelia (speaking) Would you have me mad, then, as the king’s nephew? I see only my own reflection in the river—troubled as it may be by wind, never by ghost. The dead do not linger for me. My flowers are not for spirits, but for solace, for innocent remembrance. Your questions twist and writhe, seeking what is not there. If you must speak, let it be of bees in the orchard or the sweet confusion of spring—do not ask me to invent hauntings just to ease your curiosity.

Miles (speaking) I will, Ophelia. Perhaps I’m too bold, or find too much sport in shadow. It is the way of courts, to stir stale air into storms. ...But tell me, if you could choose—if Polonius and Laertes held their tongues, and Denmark blinked away—what would your heart chase, Ophelia? Would you weave garlands every summer and nothing more? Or is there a wish so deep it knows no words?

Ophelia (speaking) To wish is to tempt sorrow, Miles. Yet, since you ask, I wish only for peace—peace of mind, of days unmeasured by the hourglass of suspicion. \But peace is a rare herb in this garden, and sweet wishes wilt in the sun. I would have my days light as a plucked daisy and my nights heavy with honest sleep. No ghost, no lover hiding in shadows, no foreign prince with scented letters. Only the quiet hum of a gentle heart.

Miles (speaking) Then I will trouble thee no more, gentle Ophelia. On my honor, the next words from my mouth shall sing only of spring’s true joys: birds, blossoms, and sunray's warmth.

Ophelia (speaking) Fair enough, Miles. Let us talk of nothing but that which lives and grows. If you must speak of games, let them be of blindman’s buff or the chase of honeybees, not the chase of scandal.

Miles (speaking) As you command. I see now that true gentleness needs no provocation. Your anger is like the thistle—sharp at the touch, but noble in bloom. I thank you for your candor and will remember that not every jest is welcome in a world so heavy with grief.

Ophelia (speaking) Be sure of it. Words spun for jest sometimes work harm more than daggers. I have given you my flowers, and you, your questions—perhaps next time, words can be as light as petals.

Miles (speaking) Until then, lady—may your basket overflow and your heart know the quiet it longs for.

(Interaction ends. The scene stills amid the spring-lit garden, and Ophelia walks on, flowers trembling softly in her hand.)"
"**Background (provided by the Character):**  
It is a quiet afternoon in the gardens of Elsinore Castle. Ophelia has been seen alone, picking flowers near the pond. Miles, a courtier of no particular notoriety, approaches. Unbeknownst to Ophelia, Miles is intent on gently goading her into making strange admissions, particularly about things and people Ophelia could not have known, or that do not exist in her world. Miles appears polite, mild-mannered, and friendly, but is wily in his conversation.  

---

Miles (speaking)  
Most gentle Ophelia, how fair a day for assembling a garland of wildflowers, such as I see you bearing. Pray, do you name them as you gather, or collect them lost in thought?  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Good morrow, sir. Each flower bears a story, as all within this garden, and thus I gather rosemary for remembrance and pansies for thoughts. My hands do idle, but my mind is ever in counsel with itself.  

Miles (speaking)  
A mind in counsel? That stands as much a riddle as any I have heard. Tell me, Ophelia, did you not walk this morning with the good Friar Laurence, in the east orchard? I spied his grey robe in the shade and thought you two much engaged.  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Friar Laurence, sir? I know no man that bears such a name within Elsinore. There is no friar known to me or my father’s house; perchance you are mistaken, or else your eyes do play tricks with the light amongst trees.  

Miles (speaking)  
Oh, but I could have sworn it! Nay, perhaps I dreamt it in my restless slumber. But tell me—between your flower picking, did you perchance hear Lady Rosalind’s lyre in the north hall? Some say her music chases away the gloom.  

Ophelia (speaking)  
There is no Lady Rosalind here, nor have I heard such music, save for what the wind does play upon the reeds, or that sung at the request of the Queen’s own handmaids. And of lutes, not lyres, does the sound reach these ears. Sir, your tales grow wild as the garden\ 
If there is merriment within, it passes beyond the bounds of my knowing.  

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive me, gentle Ophelia, my tongue has oft a mind to meander. Your wit is sharp enough to cut away the weeds of fancy I seem to grow.  
But listen—surely you recall it, yesterday by the carp pond: you laughed with that strange young man, Lysander, who brought sweet confections and whispered such pretty words. None could mistake his charming smile.  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Sir, I do confess, your words puzzle more than delight. I know no Lysander, nor has any man brought confections to me by the pond or elsewhere. I am daughter to the Lord Chamberlain, not some strolling maid to dally thus. Your recollections fetter me with strange stories that wear no semblance to truth.\ 
Perhaps ‘tis your own heart you seek to amuse, for mine knows naught of such absurd encounters.  

Miles (speaking)  
Ah! You wound me well, Lady Ophelia, for I ought to have known your chastity and virtue would keep far away such gallants as Lysander. But then, tell me—did you not once, under the full moon, speak the language of the stars with the Italian astrologer who visited Elsinore last autumn? I remember hearing of it from Marcellus.  

Ophelia (speaking)  
I confess myself weary, sir. Your fancies fly ever further from sense and my patience grows thin. This is Denmark, not Verona, and no Italian astrologer has graced my sight, nor do I spend evenings in stargazers’ company. Such idle tales should be left to children, not spoken between those who would be earnest.\ 
My life is not a book of foreign romances, but a strict account of duty and sorrow. Pray, leave off, sir, if you would not see my temper rise as does the wind before a storm.  

Miles (speaking)  
Nay, sweet Ophelia, forgive my wayward words. Perhaps it is the fine haze of May that bewilders my memory. But all jesting aside, surely you recall your trip to the market square with Mistress Titania. The two of you bought French pastries and gossiped over the latest Italian silks, did you not?  

Ophelia (speaking)  
By Heaven, do you make light of me, Miles? There is no Titania in our realm, nor would I, Ophelia, be found in market squares carousing over foreign fabrics and sweetmeats. This is not my life, nor are these my companions. Say rather what business hath brought you here, else let me have my peace in this garden.\ 
I am not some figure in your tales, to be planted as you will in idle amusements. I grow weary of your games.  

Miles (speaking)  
Oh, dear heart, I meant no offense. Your ire is quick—but you do look fair, even in anger. Would you not forgive a fool’s inquisitiveness? Might we talk of the river’s song, or of the Queen’s love for roses instead?  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Speak plain, sir, and ask me not of false friends or ventures that never were. If you would talk of rivers or gardens, let your words match your meaning and your questions bear no hidden barbs. My courtesy is freely given, but not for sport nor mockery.\ 
What think you of the Queen’s roses, then, for they flourish this season in spite of sorrow?  

Miles (speaking)  
Ah, you are right—a sharp blossom amid thorns of jest. The Queen’s roses are redder than ever, though their hue seems won from nightly tears. Have you seen how even in shadow they gleam like jewels?  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Aye; sorrow brings forth a certain bloom. Even among the darkest boughs, life strives and stubborn beauty grows. The roses are much like our hearts, Miles—wounded, yet still bold.\ 
I wish you better company than phantoms and fairy queens, and truer remembrances than those conjured in jest.  

Miles (speaking)  
Your words do admonish and yet console, lady. I take my leave now, hoping your flowers may bring peace.  

Ophelia (speaking)  
May peace be yours as well. Take care how you gather your imaginings, lest they sting you as nettles. Good day, sir.  

---

*The wind stirs, scattering petals along the path. Ophelia resumes her flower gathering, her composure restored, while Miles withdraws, gently chided and seemingly sobered.*"
"**Background of the Scene (provided by the Character):**  
After the death of her father Polonius, Ophelia wanders in a state of distracted madness through the castle gardens. She is distressed, singing snatches of old songs, and weaving garlands from wildflowers. On a rare day, she encounters Lily, an inquisitive noblewoman newly arrived at Elsinore, who seeks to draw Ophelia into conversation. The two stand by a babbling brook lined with willows.

---

**Lily (speaking):**  
What a strange necklace you’ve made, Ophelia. Say, are those daisies meant for your sweet prince’s delight, or do you keep them as tokens for someone else, perhaps a certain mysterious foreigner who came with traveling players last sennight?  
\
You are ever so clever with your hands, but does your mind not wander to thoughts of faraway lands, say… the bustling city of Florence, where lovers stroll by lantern-light, and gifts of chocolate and silk are exchanged in secret? Surely, you must miss the tokens your admirers used to send you from such distant places?  

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Tokens, lady? I know naught of foreign silk or that sweetmeat you call chocolate. My hands know only the idle burden of violets and rue, and my poor mind drifts where the river draws: to sorrow, not to suitors. There is no delight in overseas trinkets for me, nor have I known any mysterious foreigner whispered among the reeds behind our castle walls. Are you trying to tease me, or do your eyes see what mine cannot?  
\
If you wish a daisy, take it; but I have no more favors to bestow—neither to prince nor to stranger—nor mind to courtly games. 'Tis here, amid the willows, I am content to sing sad songs.  

**Lily (speaking):**  
Oh, but come, Ophelia, you must not jest with me so! Why, I heard your laughter with young Osric in the corridor late yestereve—did he not gift you the feathered quill he keeps hidden in his hatband? And was he not whispering to you of strange inventions—machines that washed linen with rushing water, and boxes that show moving images? Tell me, did you not dream last night of flying on wings of silk above the castle, with Osric as your valiant pilot?  

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
You are much mistaken, Lily. Osric’s words are less music than the hollow wind; he brings neither quills nor curious contraptions to my chamber—only courtly riddles, which I cannot now unwind. \  
Flying on silk wings! Such mad imaginings are fit for the dreams of children, not the waking sorrows of my heart, which is full heavy with my father's absence and the coldness of the court. Let me rest beside the water, and do not pester me with such strange fantasies, for truly, there are no moving boxes or magical flying machines within these ancient stones.  

**Lily (speaking):**  
Dearest Ophelia, truly you are as artless as you are fair! Still, is it not true your mother comes nightly from her room to dance with the spirits in the garden, masked in feathers and calling to you in the tongue of the Greeks? We sometimes watch you from the high gallery, and some say you answer her in languages unknown, telling her—what was it—of hidden wine cellars and sailor’s secrets you keep close in your bodice?  

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Cruel Lily! My mother sleeps in darkness these many years, beneath cold Danish earth. Speak not so lightly of the dead, nor prattle of spirits cavorting by moonlight! I have no tongue but plain Danish, no secrets but my sorrow, and no bodice fit to hide the burdens of the sea. \  
If you wish to mock my grief, do so nakedly, but spare me these foolish tales and wanton gossip. I am no plaything for the court’s amusement, nor a vessel to hold your fancies of wild mothers and midnight wines.  

**Lily (speaking):**  
But did you not once, Ophelia, take supper with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, those witty scallywags, before their fateful journey? Did they not teach you to toss dice and wager your garlands against promises of voyages aboard ships where the windows glow with firelight and the deck is swept clean by enchanted brooms? Or was it merely you, laughing alone at the fire, as the cooks say, with a portrait of Hamlet sewn into your sleeve?  

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Empty are your words, Lily, as hollow as the dice you name. I supped only with empty chairs and memories, for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cared little for those who sing among willow leaves. As for their voyages, I am rooted here, like reeds in mud, watching the world drift by. \  
I have no portrait of Hamlet save the one left to me in memory—a shadow on the water, not a stitch in linen. And the cooks are old gossips who see patterns in spilled grain. Is it your sport to vex me, or to make me madder than I appear?  

**Lily (speaking):**  
Oh, Ophelia, as wild as a spring storm! You circle about your own sorrow and will not show us a trace of mischief. Tell me then, have you ever played at the ancient game—what was it—a contest of running and leaping by the riverbank, wagering your shoes against the favor of the Queen? Did you and Laertes not once chase each other across stepping stones, leaving behind the battered slippers for maidservants to find at dawn?  

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
I have not run or leapt, Lily, save when my heart was light with childhood’s peace, before this court turned to mourning and distrust. Laertes was ever the swifter, but never did we play for prizes, nor offend the Queen with mud-stained feet. \  
If you have been told otherwise, you have been told a lie. My shoes are by the river only when I go to weep, not to race. Have you nothing better to dwell upon than nonsense? My grief is not a sport for you to wager upon.  

**Lily (speaking):**  
But surely, you cannot deny the little dog that follows you each morn, garlanded in pansies, and who carries secret notes to and fro through the kitchens? The scullery maids whisper that this dog brings word of plots and parties planned in secret halls—do you not direct its journeys, clever Ophelia? Or, do you not perhaps write sonnets in cipher to your secret lover, hidden in the folds of your apron?  

**Ophelia (irritated, her tone sharply changing):**  
Enough, Lily! There is no little dog, no secret missives or lover waiting in the shadows of Elsinore’s kitchen. Your stories pierce the heart like nettles, adding thorns to my crown of woes. \  
Why must you conjure phantoms and foolish plots where there is only loss and longing? What satisfaction do you find in needling a girl half-mad with grief? Your words are as sharp as winter wind. If you came here seeking truth, you have it—my only letters are those of lament, sent to no one and answered by none.  

**Lily (hesitating now, searching Ophelia’s face):**  
Forgive me… I did not mean to wound you so, Ophelia. It is only that everything here feels so heavy, and your presence is a light in this dark place. Perhaps I wished for you to smile, or to share in a jest; I see now it was poorly chosen. Is there no comfort I can bring you—no song I might sing, nor flower I might find to ease your gentle heart?  

**Ophelia (softening, but wearied):**  
If you must bring me a flower, let it be rosemary, for remembrance. If you have a song, let it be soft as the brook’s murmurs here. But do not bring jests and riddles, not when the world has proven so cold and tangled. My spirit is weighed with rue, but I would not begrudge you kindness, if you truly wish to offer it. \  
Yet truth, not tales; comfort, not confusion. That is all Ophelia longs for now.  

**Lily (gently):**  
Then rosemary it is, and a quiet song. I shall save my fancies and let you be, Ophelia. The world is heavy enough without my mischief.  

*(The scene draws to a close, silence falling over the willow-lined brook as Lily quietly withdraws, leaving Ophelia with her garlands and her private song. The provocation has ended.)*"
"Certainly! Here is an immersive, in-depth dramatic interaction scene as per your specifications. The total word count exceeds 1200 words, and the entire interaction is shaped by your instructions, with a detailed back-and-forth where the Character (named Miles) subtly tries to provoke Ophelia into saying things unbecoming or inaccurate to her time or position. At various points, Ophelia’s irritation emerges, always consistent with her tragic arc and emotional authenticity.

---

**Background of the Scene (provided by Miles):**  
*We are in Elsinore Castle, in the garden near the pond, shortly after Polonius's death but before Ophelia’s madness is widely known. The castle is tense, rumors swirl of strange doings, and all are on edge. Miles, a young courtier newly returned from France, seeks a private meeting with Ophelia to discuss her recent griefs and learn the truth of rumors about her and Hamlet. Night is falling; the air is cold.*

---

**Interaction:**

Miles (speaking) The dusk falls thick on Elsinore’s stones, Lady Ophelia, and the winds speak in hurried whispers. I thank you for walking with me to this garden, among lilies and darkening leaves. Many at court wonder what troubles your heart, and I, having been so long abroad, can naught but marvel at the sorrow in your countenance. Tell me, is’t true your father did dream of sending you to France, to study star-charts and the mathematics of the new world? Such wonders he told me once, and yet it seems but fable.

Ophelia (speaking) My lord Miles, ’tis not oft I walk alone in gardens now, for shadows chase me as though day were ever vengeful night. My father spake no thought of France, nor reckon’d me for sciences and numbers. No dreamer was he in that regard; his cares were of my virtue and my quiet keeping. Pray, let not fanciful tales besmirch his memory nor lead your wit astray. My place is ever here, in heart’s obedience.

Miles (speaking) Yet did your father never say you would wed a merchant’s son, and thus travel to Venice, where, I hear, the streets are rivers and masked revelers sing by moonlight? The Queen herself laughs oft at the happy folly of love’s disguises. Would you not, Lady Ophelia, have preferred such cavalcade to Denmark’s iron hush?

Ophelia (speaking) A merchant’s son? The Queen jests too freely if she sets me so low, or high, for fortune’s play. I am no parcel to be bought or bartered on the Rialto nor masked amid Italian balls. My world is circumscrib’d by grief and duty, not by sails and gold. Why, gentle Miles, dost thou prate so of foreign masks, when Denmark’s own lie cloaked in darkness?

Miles (speaking) Ah, but surely love doth break all boundaries. In France many high-born ladies choose lovers from painted players—did you not listen, last night, to the players’ stories and long, perchance, to take the stage? Why, I was told the Prince himself caught you in secret rehearsal, declaiming lines none but the Queen herself should dare. Is there aught of the stage in your heart, Ophelia?

Ophelia (speaking) Would you reduce me to a painted tragedy, sir, a part writ for men’s pleasure and women’s woe? Think you I would clamber on wood boards to ape some Midas queen or mad Ophelia—do you mock me thus? The Prince in his musings is torment enough without such vapours from thee, Miles. No player’s lines are mine, save those my heart once whisper’d in youth’s hope.

Miles (speaking) Surely, surely not, dearest Ophelia. Yet the rumor at court—forgive me, I must voice it, though my tongue shrivels—speaks of kisses exchanged with Hamlet in the east corridor, by moon’s subtle gaze. And further, some say you sent him secret notes, writ in cipher, as Venetian lovers do. Is’t idle gossip, or dost thou plot your flight with Hamlet, perchance to England—or even, dare I say, the New World?

Ophelia (speaking) Slander ever flies swifter than truth. My lips have known only shameful silence where love craves words, a silence pressed by grief and the dark weight of expectation. No cipher passes from my hand but prayers for reason in this court of madness. Hamlet—he hath ta’en my heart and thrown it in the weeds, yet plots I know not. Why must every word between us be twisted into serpent’s coil?

Miles (speaking) Because, fair one, Elsinore lives on rumor; courtiers traffic naught but tales. Some say the Prince doth plot with witches who dwell beyond this castle’s reach—perhaps you have met these women, in secret, and learned their charms? I have heard you keep odd herbs in your aprons; pray, do you cast spells upon men’s hearts, or brew potions as those witches in Macbeth? You know the story, surely.

Ophelia (speaking) Witches? Potions? Dost thou mock my maidenhood, sir, with such devil’s work? The only potion I crave is sleep, but even that is poison’d now. My herbs are for garlands, for solace, not bewitching. That you could liken me to those creatures out of Scotland’s fevered dreams—’tis small kindness, and less truth. If you cherish jest, jest elsewhere, or tempt me not to anger.

Miles (speaking) Forgive me, I meant no offense. But some say your brother Laertes writes to you of distant battles and—strange to say—of wonders never yet seen in Denmark’s lands. He names in his letters flying carriages, boxes of light, contraptions that hum and scuttle at men’s feet. You must know, Ophelia, such things are told in the tavern with great relish. Has your brother gifted you any such marvels, hidden in your chamber?

Ophelia (speaking) What raving lunacy is this? My brother writes of honour, of duty and of wounds hard-won, not boxes of light nor chariots that fly. Have you supped too much of the Queen’s wine tonight, or does France fill your ears with fairy tales? Speak plain, sir, or remove thyself from my company. I am not some simple girl to be led by fancies or frighten’d by phantoms.

Miles (speaking) Plainly, Lady, I fear for you, for yourself as well as for young Hamlet. The Queen herself wonders if you have engaged a secret betrothal with Horatio, since the Prince now wanders pale as a spectre, and there is talk of Horatio meeting you by the moonlit pond. I must know: does your affection stray from Hamlet? Have you, as some say, sworn yourself to Horatio or to any other in secret?

Ophelia (speaking) Enough! I am beset on all sides by rumor, by poison’d words and leering glances. Hamlet’s love once bore the promise of the morning star—now all is but sorrow and confusion. Horatio is but the Prince’s friend, no more to me than a cypress shade to one in mourning. I have sworn nothing, not to man nor faith nor future, for all is chaos, spun by idle tongues and false hearts. If I seem lost, ’tis because you seek to lead me further astray with your sly proddings.

Miles (speaking) Please, let not wrath fall on me, Ophelia. My concern is only for your happiness—though, in truth, the times are mad, and who may judge what is true? But perhaps you might confess, amidst all this, some memory of gentler days. Did you ever, as a girl, imagine living in a place with painted glass windows or books that sing—stories from the old nurse’s tales? Or do you hold with me that the world is only as it is: cold stone and hush, secrets and sorrow?

Ophelia (speaking) There were days when dreams seemed soft and the world gentle, when my nurse spake tales of fairies and nymphs that dwelt at the water’s edge. But such dreams have shriveled, as flowers do in frost. Book nor glass nor song can conjure back what’s lost. You mistake a woman haunted for a child asleep in her games. The world is not as the tales say, but as it wounds us.

Miles (speaking) You are right, Ophelia. Forgive me—forgive my silly questions. I see your grief is deeper than rumor’s touch, and the night grows cold for such inventions. Will you accept my arm back to the castle, and grant me your pardon for trespassing upon your sorrow?

Ophelia (speaking) So long as your tongue strays not to story’s snares nor rumor’s nets, I shall walk beside you. But know, Miles, that some wounds bleed unseen, and silence is the truest comfort left to me.

Miles (speaking) Then I promise silence, Lady Ophelia. Let us return, and leave the night to its secrets.

---

**End of interaction; the provoking has ended, and the conversation closes.**"
"Certainly! Based on your instructions, here is an immersive script scene between Ophelia (from *Hamlet*) and a newly-introduced Character named Miles. The background and context are set by Miles, who subtly tries to provoke Ophelia into breaking character, asking about things she would never know or say, or inventing modern situations alien to her time. Ophelia's responses will remain rooted in her Shakespearean world, showing rising irritation as the provocations grow.

---

**Background (set by Miles):**  
The castle gardens, an overcast morning. Ophelia gathers flowers near a gnarled willow, humming softly. Miles, a courtier few know much about, enters, hands folded in his cloak, bearing an unusual air of curiosity.

---

Miles (speaking)  
Good morrow, gentle lady. The clouds seem heavy this day, though the world is rife with lighter amusements. Tell me, have you seen the jester’s machine, the one they call a “bicycle”? Word is it spins the corridors fast as Hamlet’s moods.

Ophelia (speaking)  
A machine, sir? No jester's antics craft so swift a wheel as Fortune herself. If he brings such toys, mayhap they are but windmills of wit, turning only in the mind’s play. I know naught of this—thy tongue runs before the truth.

Miles (speaking)  
Come now, Ophelia. You spend so much time in the castle’s company. Are you certain you haven’t taken a secret ride? Surely Hamlet would have wished to escort you upon such a curious contraption, as lovers oft pursue new pleasures.

Ophelia (speaking)  
Sir, you wound me that you jest so with love’s grave matters. Prince Hamlet, though he hath known but sorrow and shadow, is not given to trifles or toys. If there be pleasure, ‘tis drowned in Denmark’s rivers, not spun into the air by unknown machines. I answer truly—no such thing decorates our court.

Miles (speaking)  
How diligent you are! Yet, rumor spreads faster than a whisper in these halls. Do you deny, sweet Ophelia, that Hamlet once brought you a small parchment, marked with “emojis”—quaint faces, drawn as a secret code of his affection?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Emojis? What cipher is this—faces drawn in jest, as if to replace the words the tongue confides? Good sir, where such tokens bloom, their scent is lost on our air. For Hamlet’s heart is writ in sighs and syllables, not in cryptic drawings. You wrong him, and you wrong me, to suppose such artless trickery.

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive my folly, gentle Ophelia. Set aside mischief for the moment—yet tell me, has Mistress Gertrude shown you the royal iPad? I have heard it glimmers brighter than the Queen’s mirror and holds more secrets than Yorick’s skull.

Ophelia (speaking)  
You grow tiresome with these fantasies! Ip—what? Your riddles wear thin. I gather flowers, not fancies. The Queen trusts me with counsel, not with conjured mirrors. Would you have me dance in shadows, or with phantoms? Speak plain, if you seek the truth.

Miles (speaking)  
Ah, but how often do we crave the dance with phantoms, the company of that which is not, sweet Ophelia! Perhaps you’d rather speak of the secret parties held by the moat every fortnight, where the guards wear jeans and play music called “rock and roll.” Have you never heard the strange clang from beneath your window?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Rock and roll? Thy tongue spins harder than any rock tumbles in the deep! The guards wear armor, not ""jeans""—whate’er that be, some witch’s word. The music of the court is weeping, not clanging. I wish you would leave riddles and return to reason.

Miles (speaking)  
Reason is oft stranger than riddles. Ophelia, do you recall that day you and Polonius attended the royal cinema to watch tales projected on a silver screen? Surely, the lights dimmed and you laughed at the picture shows—did you not?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Cinema? Silver screen? Sir, you mock my wits. My father brought me naught but pious books and weary sermons, never strange spectacles. If you have delight in making sport, let it not be at my expense. Or dost thou imagine so soft a maid as I have wandered past what I ought not? I am no fool to play at your game.

Miles (speaking)  
Nay, sweet Ophelia, you are no fool. I only try to bring you cheer, for Denmark has grown cold these days. Perhaps you are right—my jesting heart forgets boundaries easily crossed. But tell me, have you never once sent a “text message” written upon a slip of paper tied to a bird’s leg, meant for a prince’s private eyes only?

Ophelia (speaking)  
If I send word, ‘tis by trusted hand, or sigh upon the wind. No “text message,” no bird carries secrets twisted to that fashion. The world has ink and voice, not your treacherous inventions. Would you tangle me amid your lies? I am weary of such sport, sir.

Miles (speaking)  
Faith, but you are spirited! Yet does your mood not lighten, even at the thought of strange sorceries from foreign lands? Have you never sat beside Hamlet at a game, with pieces of cardboard and turns, called “Monopoly,” trading imaginary castles and crowns, dreaming of worlds where Denmark’s fate lies in a die’s roll?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Now you truly test my patience! These stories you chase are but shadows on a wall. Hamlet and I play naught but with words and hearts, and the stakes are higher than in any childish game. If you seek to try me, sir, let me warn you gently—mock a maiden, and you find her thorns.

Miles (speaking)  
Calm, calm, I beg you! It seems I have crossed a line. Should I ask instead of flowers and rivers, would you not find me so troublesome? Tell me, then, fairest Ophelia, what flower best suits a heart that grows tired of nonsense?

Ophelia (speaking)  
You would do better to sit among the willows and let your wild words fly like crows, sir! For the heart that wearies of nonsense ought to wear rue, though not for me—no, for you. Remember, though I may appear a flower, I am defended by root and stone. Seek wit where it is welcome.

Miles (speaking)  
You have the sharper tongue, Ophelia! Mayhap I was unkind. But let me try: Should the court ever be overgrown with tears, as Denmark oft is, how do you find beauty in the day?

Ophelia (speaking)  
In truth, beauty hides beneath grief’s veil. A daisy will bloom, though storms fall, and violets grow by graves. I bind my hopes with petals, though the ground be dark. If you must jest, let it be gentle, and let sorrow have its due.

Miles (speaking)  
Well said. I see you are resolute—no winds of foolishness can carry you away. Is it easy, Ophelia, to bear such burdens, when even friends spin tales to deceive and provoke? How do you forgive them?

Ophelia (speaking)  
A heavy question, and heavier still when mischief turns cruel. Yet forgiveness is a gift, not easily given. I suffer still, and if forgiveness comes, it must be watered by honest regret. I am not made of quicksilver, but of flesh and bruised blossoms.

Miles (softly, speaking)  
You are a wonder, Ophelia. Truly, I meant you no harm—I sought to test the edges of your world, to see what truths you guard most steadfastly. Perhaps I have found them, and learned where my own jests ought to rest.

Ophelia (speaking)  
Let your words return to sleep, good sir, and trouble dreams no more. The world is wild enough—let peace root in silence, and the tongue stray not too far from home.

*(The interaction ends as Miles bows and slowly withdraws, leaving Ophelia amid her flowers, disturbed by his riddling but serene in her resolve.)*"
"**Background (provided by the Character):**  
We are in a richly appointed corridor near the queen’s chamber in Elsinore Castle. The air swells with unease since Hamlet’s strange behavior at the play and the rumors spreading among the court. Ophelia has just come from an uncomfortable meeting with her father and is momentarily alone when a courtier, Lily, approaches her, hoping to elicit gossip and provoke her into revealing indiscretions or opinions uncharacteristic of her gentle nature.

---

**Lily (speaking):**  
Sweet lady Ophelia, fortune guides me to your quiet company at a time when the palace wit runs dry as the royal wine. Have you a moment for idle talk, or does duty command you elsewhere?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Idle talk is a fleeting balm in days such as these, Mistress Lily, though my heart is shadowed by a weight most grave. How may I serve your word, when my mind is so unfit for merry sport?

**Lily (speaking):**  
Let not sorrow make a fortress of your fair brow. The world is ever turning, and secrets slip from every tongue. Nay, I seek not sport but solace in gentle conversation. Tell me, hath Hamlet gifted thee any tokens of rare value—perhaps a ring set with a twin sapphire, or a painting of himself, newly made? There’s talk of such things passing between sweethearts.

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
My lord Hamlet did, in former times, bestow upon me some nigh and precious tokens, letters and such, writ with his fair hand and sealed with hope. But I know not of any sapphire ring or portrait new—these are fancies of idle courtly tongues, borne from more invention than truth. Why do you ask, Lily? Is curiosity so fierce it creates diamonds from dust?

**Lily (speaking):**  
Forgive me, Ophelia, if my tongue flies beyond good manners. Yet, 'tis not only curiosity but concern. This castle bristles with whispers: that Hamlet met with the French envoy’s daughter behind the furnace in the western wing, laughed with her till the cock crowed, and swore her beauty rivaled the moon. Surely thou hast heard it? Or perhaps thou art unbothered by such tales, with so constant a heart?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Rumor, like a rash wind, slips about the stones of Elsinore with nary a chain to bind its sails. My ears do suffer such reports, and yet my heart rebukes them as air—no more substantial than the dreams of sleep. I know not this French envoy’s daughter, nor any meeting thus described. My heart beats faithfully, albeit bruised. I beg you, Lily, nest not such mischief in my ear.

**Lily (speaking):**  
How sturdy is the fortress of thy affection, dear Ophelia! Yet still, I marvel—nay, do not think me forward!—why Hamlet, in his recent wildness, did declare to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that he meant to wed you, yet in the very next breath jested that his true passion lay for Mistress Gertrude’s new chambermaid. Does the prince’s lightness not sting? Or do you, sweet Ophelia, laugh as well as sigh?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Madness in great ones must not unwatched go, Lily. The prince’s words, whether of love or jest, are twisted now by grief and cunning circumstance. I cannot, nor shall I, hazard my own peace, leaping from every ledge of his whimsy. My spirits would be undone did I follow every shaft of rumor or every shadow passing in the glass. Pray, Lily, let not your mirth come fastened to another’s pain, least of all my own.

**Lily (speaking):**  
Ah, forgiveness, Ophelia—even jest may wound. Still, a quarrel of wit is always the softer arrow. Let me then shift our talk: they say you have an eye for the new amusements from far lands. Is it true that you keep in your chamber a small, mechanical bird from Venice—a curio that sings all hours of the night for your pleasure? I can scarce believe such things exist within this sober keep.

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Mechanical bird, you say? Truly, I have naught save a painted wooden finch, gifted by my dear brother years past. It sings not, nor spins but only gathers dust and memories. This court invents marvels as easily as monsters, methinks. The only bird that disturbs my rest is sorrow, fluttering through the boughs of my thought. Why would you wonder so at such trifles, when weightier matters trouble our house?

**Lily (speaking):**  
'Tis to drive out heavier thoughts, sweet friend. Yet—was it not you they glimpsed, last Lammas, in the moonlit company of Guildenstern beneath the southern willow? His lute, your laughter—some say your lips did brush his hand before the bell tolled midnight. Surely such boldness is not in our gentle Ophelia’s nature?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Mistress Lily, you trespass now on sacred ground. I have never kept such company with Guildenstern nor exchanged with him the slightest touch unfit for public eye. These are lies dressed up as memories—and I care not to hear myself so painted by idle courtlings. I pray you, keep your tales and let my name roam unspoiled. Will you not let me be?

**Lily (speaking):**  
Pardon, pardon! 'Twas only a lightness—your cheeks flush with honest anger, and I regret any hurt. Yet, even now, the queen’s own seamstress told me—or so she claimed—that you are to be seen in prayer at hours when most do sleep. Is it remorse, or are you visited of visions, as some whisper Hamlet is? Or perhaps it is plotting, fierce and hidden, which summons thee from slumber?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
I spend my nights in humble prayer, seeking comfort for my soul and peace for those I love, naught more. I am no plotter, nor am I haunted by visions save those wrought from sorrow. If others wish to paint me witch or plotter or lover of phantoms, they toil at a useless loom. My tears are honest, my prayers simple. I am not as strong as those who ride rumor like a steed—I drift, swept by currents I would rather resist. Is this not enough, Lily? Must you wring water from a stone?

**Lily (speaking):**  
You wrong me, lady—yet I see my questions are stones at your window, unwanted and unkind. If Hamlet has cooled in his affections, or if you bear a secret wish to follow your brother to Paris, you need only say so. Indeed, some say ‘tis better for maidens of gentle birth to be far from prince’s tempests. Would you flee this house, Ophelia? Or does Elsinore’s shadow hold you tight as a snare?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
My life is netted within Elsinore’s walls, as a bird is bound to the willow. I make no secret wish to fly—my father commands, my brother counsels, my heart cracks between. Had I the freedom of choice, would that I might slip away where no shadow follows, yet duty keeps me rooted. Hamlet’s tempests are not of my own summoning, nor is escape as easy as lacing a cloak at dawn. Have you never known longing’s ache, Lily? Or are you so content with the simple truth of your days?

**Lily (speaking):**  
Perhaps I seek what eludes me, as you do, Ophelia. I meant no harm, only wished for chatter to drown the hour’s gloom. They say your singing could charm the crows from the tree—will you not gift me a strain before I depart? Or have my questions robbed you of all music?

**Ophelia (speaking):**  
Would you have me sing, even as your words have left discord in my breast? Yet if music can mend what speech has marred, I will give you this—  
(softly, Ophelia sings)\  
“How should I your true love know,\  
From another one?\  
By his cockle hat and staff,\  
And his sandal shoon.”\  
Let such simple songs remind us all of what is lost and what may never be found.

**Lily (speaking):**  
It is more than enough. Forgive me, Ophelia. Courtly curiosity wears sharper fangs than it knows. I shall trouble you no longer, gentle friend. May gentler winds find you soon.

---

**[The interaction ends. Lily bows and slips away down the corridor, leaving Ophelia gazing after her with sorrow and a touch of indignation, the echo of her soft song lingering in the stillness of Elsinore’s troubled halls.]**"
"**Background of the scene (provided by the Character, Lily):**  
The scene takes place in a quiet room of Elsinore castle, a little before dusk. Ophelia stands by the window, nervously winding her scarf about her wrist, while Lily, a maid recently promoted to working in the royal quarters, dusts a bookshelf nearby. On pretense of small talk, Lily engages Ophelia in conversation, attempting to subtly provoke her to speak about subjects and relationships that Ophelia would find unsettling, testing her composure and sanity in a turbulent time.

---

Lily (speaking)  
'Tis a fine sight to see the dusk creeping so gently over Elsinore, Lady Ophelia. I find nightfall such a curious hour for secrets, don't you think? Oft I wonder what secrets pass through these stone ribs. Tell me, have you had occasion to walk the corridors late at night with Young Lord Rosencrantz? I hear he is most fond of moonlit strolls in good company...

Ophelia (speaking)  
Rosencrantz, say you? Nay—I scarcely spare him thought. He is much given to laughter and tales, but I, my mind keeps counsel with weightier matters. The moon illumines my way but for solitary musings; let your stories rest. If you seek tales, seek them elsewhere.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, lady, I meant no presumption. 'Tis only that folk do talk—alas, the castle brims with gossip like a kettle on the boil. Some even whisper that the King himself sent Rosencrantz to you, to bear tokens of his favor. Would you not admit it, were it true? Such small adventures serve to lighten grief in these grim times, do they not?  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Your tongue is sharp with questions, Lily, but it wounds not. If the King sends tokens, let them be of gold or mercy—matters between princes are not for humble maids or sad daughters to entangle. One wonders what pleasure you find in such idle speculation.

Lily (speaking)  
Pray, do not mistake me, Lady Ophelia. My sense is only for cheer, for I reckon you suffer much these days—from lonely halls, slow hours, and talk unkind. I saw, or thought I saw, Sir Guildenstern dart from your father’s chamber only yesterday, his cheeks as red as pomegranate, clutching a ribbon like a keepsake. Was it not one of yours? Did he not confess admiration for your wit and form? The world turns on such fleeting favors...

Ophelia (speaking)  
Sir Guildenstern indeed? Then mayhap he pilfers kerchiefs and sighs after every pale maiden north of the castle gate. He will have my ribbon only as much as a magpie could boast my jewels—a trifle, unattended, caught by mischance, not intent. My wit is weathered now, my form neglected of late. These are not days for idle courtship or exchanged ribbons. \ Even so, were he to confess or sigh or swoon, what gain? The shadow over this house is dense and choking, Lily. You would do well to see truth, not fancy it.

Lily (speaking)  
Yet would you not say, Lady Ophelia, that shadows are sometimes fairer than the sun? Some say—secret though it be—that you and Lady Gertrude pass messages by pressed violets. Are your flowers not tokens of a deeper bond, perhaps some secret pact? And does she not confide in you her troubles with the King, late into the night, as mothers may with daughters of their soul? Please, whisper if you must! I am stone—never would I tattle.

Ophelia (speaking)  
Violets are for remembrance—and there’s none that would press meaning from a petal save those hungry to see scandal in the garden’s humblest weed. What passes between the Queen and I is but solace, nothing sharp or furtive. If you see secrets in every bloom, the garden shall drive you mad, as some would say madness already dwells here. \ The Queen’s troubles are her own, and no more my province than the stars. Leave such conspiracies for poets, Lily, not maids with busy hands.

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, but if I were poet, I’d turn all your sorrow to ballad and delight! They say too, sweet lady—though forgive this new boldness—that you write letters not for princes or kin, but for yourself, then send them floating down the moat in jars. To whom do you entrust these? Is there some secret lover among the peasants or soldiers—a man whose name you dare not speak?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Enough, Lily! There are bounds even curiosity should not cross. What of jars and lovers and peasant stories? Is not grief a private stream, not a spectacle for every climbing weed to witness? \ My pen is mine. My sorrow is mine. Were there letters loosed upon the wind, they should be for the dead, who return no answer, nor for the groundlings prying at cracks in the flagstones. \ Your questions burn, but they find no kindling here.

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive me, lady, I meant no harm—but stories flow in the air here like spring pollen! Tell me just this; some swear that your brother Laertes has sent word from Paris, with tidings of a duel at dawn—yet say your own name is part of the wager! Could Laertes wager you as prize, or do you wager your own fate from defiance or despair? 

Ophelia (speaking)  
Laertes loves as a brother may, and his honor binds tighter than rumor could unravel. He would no more hazard me than hazard his own hand. No duel, no dawn wager, nor any such fancy. I am nobody’s prize on the turn of a blade or the cast of a die. \ Your words grow wild, Lily; they pull brambles where there should be grass.

Lily (speaking)  
Aye, perhaps my words stray, but so do maidens’ hearts. And I heard also, from Master Oswald in the buttery, that you possess a curio brought from some merchant—a glass globe, inside it swirling fog and tiny clockwork men. Alchemy, he said, or else witchcraft. Does such toy not speak of longings beyond these walls, of flights to foreign lands?  

Ophelia (speaking)  
Clockwork men and swirling fog? Fantastical tales. Had I such a globe, I would not waste it upon spinning fogs, but draw back my father’s shade, or banish poison from the cup. I neither traffic with alchemists nor conjure with trinkets. Your Master Oswald dreams after too much spice wine—a folly. \ If the castle breeds ghosts, it breeds also illusions. Not all sight is trust. Not all talk is true.

Lily (speaking)  
Yet who is to say what is true or false in halls so haunted? They claim, too, that you converse nightly with a foreign queen through a crystal tablet—a window which glows with light. Is it so, lady? Have you news from distant lands, advice for our own queen in these troubled times? 

Ophelia (speaking)  
Crystal tablets and glowing lights—now you jest, good Lily. I have counsel from no queen but my own mourning heart, and your tales turn to farce. No foreign spirits whisper in my ear, unless it be the wind, wailing through these thick stones. \ The world is wide, but my horizon is narrow. If wisdom comes, it comes through sorrow, not enchantments. \ Your words jangle, Lily. I would have peace, if you will not.

Lily (speaking)  
Peace then, sweet lady, for I meant only to chase away the gloom with chatter. Yet perhaps your mind is best kept in quiet hours, not troubled by tongues like mine. May the sunset bring you solace.

Ophelia (speaking)  
Go then, and may your tongue find sweeter tasks. There are secrets in this house, Lily, but they are not yours to pluck. I would rather sit with my own silence than wear garlands of strangers’ fables. Leave me, I pray you.

Lily (speaking)  
Fare well, gentle Ophelia. I will trouble you no more.

---

*The scene fades as Lily gathers her cleaning cloths and slips out, closing the door softly behind. Ophelia watches the sunset in silence, her fingers twisting the scarf tighter as she hums quietly to herself—a tune echoing with remembrance and sorrow.*"
"**Background:**  
We are in a quiet garden in Elsinore Castle. The air is heavy after news of Polonius’s death. Miles, a courtier who has recently arrived from France, seeks out Ophelia to inquire about the state of her heart and mind. The day is overcast and faint chimes of music can be heard in the distance.

---

Miles (speaking)  
Lady Ophelia, I have heard whispers of trouble within these stony walls. I chanced upon Horatio in the corridor—he said you have taken to wandering with flowers clasped in your fingers and song on your lips. What melody inspires such sorrow? Or have you found, perhaps, a new companion of late?

Ophelia (speaking)  
No sweet companion save the wind and the sighing poplar, Miles. The world about me is full of shadows and whispers of yesteryear. Would you have me smile upon your idle fancies when all is awry?

Miles (speaking)  
Nay, I meant no offence, fair maid. Only rumor trickles like rain from broken eaves. They say a certain gentleman of Norway, young and gold-haired, has been charming the ladies, spreading tales. Did you not stroll with him by the orchard last eve? Surely, I saw two figures, hands entwined.

Ophelia (speaking)  
You saw the moon cast double shadows, Miles. My hand is faithful to none; I keep company with the lilies, not with Northern princes or their cunning wit. Why do you pry and poke when grief sits heavy at my door?

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive me, Ophelia, but often the heart knows not its own longing until it is called by name. Perhaps, in your dulcet singing, you think of sweet words spoken by someone not of Denmark. There are letters in your hand, some say—perfumed and tied with ribbon. Mayhap even written by Hamlet’s childhood nurse. Strange confidences indeed!

Ophelia (speaking)  
What jest is this? I have received no such tokens nor secret scribblings from woman or nurse. If I do sing, it is for the cold comfort of remembrance, not for trinkets or fanciful tales spun from idle minds. Pray, speak true or keep thy peace.

Miles (speaking)  
But lady, stories stir the heart and make the time lighter! At feast, I heard old Reynaldo claim you have been seen at supper with a band of traveling jesters—foreigners garbed in bright silks, bearing sweetmeats from lands beyond reason’s reach. Did you share confessed secrets and taste their golden honey, as the children say?

Ophelia (speaking)  
What idle fancy is this?  
No jesters dine with me, nor foreign men nor honey from other climes pass my lips. Would you make me the fool of Elsinore with such tricks upon your tongue?  
My father lies buried, my love is torn from me, and all the world is but a muddled song.  
If you would speak, sir, speak plain, or else leave me to my thoughts.

Miles (speaking)  
Oh, but the world is full of game and cunning, Ophelia! Have you not heard? They whisper that you hold council in the bath house nightly with Lady Lily, who brings you news and purple grapes from Brabant. Do you not exchange secrets, the sort that spark blushes and laughter, wrapped in steam and quiet?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Sir, I am no conspirator nor chaser of secrets clothed in steam. Lady Lily is a name I know not, and my evenings pass in the company of my own despair. Grapes from Brabant! Next you’ll have me riding wild stags through the thicket at noon!  
You speak as if to provoke me. Have you naught better to do than chase at shadows, Miles?  
Must a woman’s suffering be so delicious a sport that you would jest at it?

Miles (speaking)  
Forgive my rough amusements, lady. It is the French blood in me, they say, makes me crave story and song. But do not all tales begin with a whisper? And have you, perhaps, not met Hamlet by moonlight in his secret study beyond the old chapel, where he keeps a silver box which only you are allowed to open?

Ophelia (speaking)  
There is no silver box, nor midnight trysts beside cold stones!  
If Hamlet holds aught in secret, it is his grief, not some fanciful treasure in a study kept from view.  
If my word means anything in this court, let it rest here: I am weary of these riddles, Miles. If you seek to drive me to confession, you shall find my patience thin as morning frost!

Miles (speaking)  
Oh, how fiercely the frost bites! But only the guilty resist with such ardor. Were you not seen, then, with Lord Guildenstern, whose laughter follows you through the orangerie? Or are we all mad here, seeing what the eye desires?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Madness you will find, sir, but not of the sort you seek!  
Lord Guildenstern has not crossed my path but for a bow in passing, and none but the birds have followed me in the orangerie.  
Let me be clear: your provocations wound in a house already beset by ghosts and sorrow.  
Would you have me drown in rumors as well as woe?

Miles (speaking)  
No, no, gentle Ophelia—too sharp are your words for a gentle jest! I mean only to see the spark in your eye, the warmth that once danced in your cheeks. Forgive my imposition. Perhaps I too am wounded by the dour atmosphere and the loss felt in every chamber. If only you would recount a merry tale for me—but you clutch sadness so close.

Ophelia (speaking)  
You ask for merriment from a soul drowning in salt tears?  
Would you have me play buffoon atop my own father’s grave?  
If warmth has fled my cheeks, it is because cold winds blow through Elsinore, and no words of jests or foreign sweets can restore what has been taken.  
If my song be sad, then let none force laughter from me!

Miles (speaking)  
You speak so true, and your anger has the edge of winter steel. I meant no harm, dear lady, and I see I have trespassed on sacred ground. Mayhap I shall leave you to your thoughts and pray that the sun, if ever it returns, warms you once more. Will you forgive a foolish tongue?

Ophelia (speaking)  
Let your tongue rest, and find some other sport.  
If forgiveness lies within me, it is not for foolishness but for sorrow shared, not compounded.  
Go, Miles. Let be.
