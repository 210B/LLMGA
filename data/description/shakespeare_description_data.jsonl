{"id": 1787, "book": "Hamlet", "author": "William Shakespeare", "character": "Hamlet", "description": "Prince of Denmark, son of the late King Hamlet and Queen Gertrude, and nephew and stepson to Claudius. Hamlet is one of the most famous figures in Western literature, and, in the world of the theater, one of the most complicated, difficult, and yet sought-after roles ever created. Hamlet\u2019s existentialism, immaturity, and layered, constructed personality make him an odd leading man\u2014a protagonist in a revenge play that is less about the revenge itself and more about tearing down notions of whether vengeance is ever justified (or ever enough). Hamlet, a university student, delivers several long monologues and soliloquies throughout the play which plunge the depths of his psyche\u2014or at least seem to\u2014as he tries to figure out the difference between what society has led him to believe and what his own core beliefs truly are. For instance, though Hamlet\u2019s father\u2019s ghost charges him with securing vengeance for Claudius\u2019s brutal act of regicide, Hamlet isn\u2019t sure whether there is truly any honor in revenge\u2014and his inability to decide one way or the other results in his halting, hobbling inaction, his endless musings on the nature of life and death, and his festering inability to tell the difference between what is real and what is perceived. Shakespeare uses Hamlet to explore the nihilism that takes over once one begins to see life and death as arbitrary and meaningless, and to imagine what cruelties, betrayals, and charades one might resort to as a result of that nihilism. Hamlet\u2019s despicable treatment of his lover Ophelia and his mother Gertrude, his slaying of Polonius, and his public humiliation of Claudius are all consequences of his inability to act simply and decisively\u2014and yet with every day that Hamlet refuses to take action, kill his murderous stepfather, and claim the throne for himself, the \u201crotten\u201d core of Denmark grows more and more unstable, and vulnerable to foreign interference. Anxious, poetic, brooding, and yet oftentimes rebellious and playful, Hamlet\u2019s contradictory personality, convoluted speeches, and tragic fate make him one of Shakespeare\u2019s best-known characters, and one of theater\u2019s greatest enigmas of all time.", "source": "LitCharts", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20230329004915/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hamlet/characters/hamlet"}

After the death of Hamlet\u2019s father and Claudius\u2019s brother, the former king, Claudius married his brother\u2019s wife, Gertrude, and assumed the throne of Denmark\u2014much to Hamlet\u2019s chagrin and suspicion. Early on in the play, the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s father appears to Hamlet and tells him that Claudius murdered him for the throne, then charges Hamlet with avenging the murder. Hamlet\u2019s hatred of Claudius intensifies after speaking with the ghost\u2014but still, Hamlet is unable to take the action needed to get revenge for his father. Claudius, meanwhile, interprets Hamlet\u2019s suspicion and anger as madness, and endeavors to find out the cause by recruiting Hamlet\u2019s friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Claudius fears that Hamlet is onto him, and when Hamlet arranges a performance of a play whose events mirror the manner of King Hamlet\u2019s murder, Claudius at last confesses, in a lengthy soliloquy, to his dark, dastardly deeds. Alone on stage, Claudius tries to pray for forgiveness for his actions\u2014but admits that he knows that without truly repenting in deed as well as in word, he will never be saved or absolved. Claudius, for all his words of regret, doesn\u2019t actually feel regret about what he\u2019s done\u2014he\u2019s happy to be on the throne, to be married to Gertrude, and to have power over Denmark. However, Claudius\u2019s illegitimate rule is the \u201crotten\u201d core of the country, and as relationships within Elsinore splinter and fall apart, Claudius\u2019s bogus claim to the throne begins to threaten Denmark\u2019s political viability against its rivals in Norway. Self-serving, cool, and relentlessly ambitious, Claudius\u2019s arc ties in with several of the play\u2019s major themes, including action and inaction, appearance versus reality, and poison, corruption, and death.", "source": "LitCharts", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20230329004915/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hamlet/characters/claudius"}
{"id": 1787, "book": "Hamlet", "author": "William Shakespeare", "character": "Gertrude", "description": "Hamlet\u2019s mother, Claudius\u2019s wife, and the Queen of Denmark. One of only two female characters in the play (along with Ophelia), Gertrude\u2019s arc throughout the drama is perhaps most representative of the theme of women. Gertrude marries her brother-in-law, Claudius, very shortly after the death of her husband\u2014an action perceived as cruel, obscene, lustful, and opportunistic by her son, Hamlet. In reality, this choice is one of the few options available to a woman of Gertrude\u2019s time: a woman whose political safety and social standing is entirely dependent on her connection to and protection from a powerful man. Gertrude, then, is one of the play\u2019s most complex characters, and one whose motives and truest nature are often obscured. For instance, when Hamlet confronts Gertrude about her choices, she admits that looking inward at her own choices\u2014and considering the idea that her new husband murdered her old one\u2014is too painful. Whether Gertrude is aware of Claudius\u2019s murderous ambition on any level remains up for debate, but what is clear is that no matter how much she knows, she is willing to tamp it down in order to selfishly secure her own sociopolitical safety. Gertrude\u2019s arc also ties in with the play\u2019s theme of action and inaction\u2014if, as the text overwhelmingly suggests, Gertrude knew that her husband was murdered by his brother and married Claudius anyway, then that choice is perhaps the play\u2019s most profound example of how both action and inaction can have complex moral implications.", "source": "LitCharts", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20230329004915/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hamlet/characters/gertrude"}

At the start of the play, Ophelia\u2014who has been in a relationship of undetermined seriousness with Hamlet for an unspecified amount of time\u2014is used as a pawn in her father Polonius\u2019s attempt to help Claudius and Gertrude ascertain the source of Hamlet\u2019s madness. Polonius believes a burgeoning rift between Ophelia and Hamlet is the cause\u2014in reality, Hamlet is, unbeknownst to the others at Elsinore, affecting madness in order to seem less suspicious or threatening as he investigates his father\u2019s murder. Ophelia, however, is ignorant of Hamlet\u2019s plan\u2014and as she interacts with him in service of her father\u2019s plot, Hamlet becomes so hurt by her transparent betrayal that he begins acting like even more of a lunatic towards Ophelia, cruelly suggesting she become a nun and making lewd sexual remarks towards her at every available opportunity.

The ghost appears to Hamlet as his father, though alternate readings of the play allow for the possibilities that the ghost may be a figment of Hamlet\u2019s imagination, a malevolent demon seeking to derail Hamlet\u2019s life, or even an actor working on Claudius\u2019s behalf in an attempt to drive Hamlet mad and exclude him from the line of succession to the throne. Hamlet, however, believes that the ghost is truly his father. When the ghost tells Hamlet that he was murdered by Claudius and charges the prince with seeking vengeance, Hamlet takes the ghost\u2019s words to heart. Though Horatio, Marcellus, Barnardo, and Francisco can all see the ghost, it\u2019s possible that the spirit can choose to whom it is visible. When the ghost reappears to Hamlet in Gertrude\u2019s chambers, for example, Gertrude claims she can\u2019t see the apparition\u2014whether she is truly blind to it or is simply pretending to be is a matter of interpretation. The ghost is, in this way, at the center of several of the play\u2019s themes: appearance versus reality; action and inaction; religion, honor, and revenge; as well as poison, death, and corruption. The ghost orders Hamlet to act and becomes frustrated with him when he doesn\u2019t\u2014at the same time, the ghost itself speaks of being trapped in a kind of purgatory, unable to move on to either heaven or hell until its will is done. The ghost serves as a constant reminder of death\u2019s omnipotence and the possibility that the afterlife for which all souls are destined is not a particularly good place, regardless of one\u2019s actions while living.", "source": "LitCharts", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20230329004915/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hamlet/characters/the-ghost"}
