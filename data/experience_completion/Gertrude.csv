unaware and unfortunate,Gertrude drinks from the poisoned goblet meant for Hamlet and dies.,"In the great hall, amidst the tense court and the shadow of a duel, Gertrude lifts a goblet of wine, unaware it has been poisoned and intended for Hamlet; a cruel fate draws near.
Gertrude (thinking) The air is thick with expectation, though I cannot place why my heart stirs so restlessly. Hamlet, my son, stands at the edge of something terrible, yet his eyes search for hope. If only my words could calm this storm. All eyes watch, from the king’s calculating gaze to Laertes’s trembling hands, but I—what role do I play but mother, wife, queen? I must offer comfort… for what else can I do when men are set upon destruction?
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, the wine sits idle, untouched by lips too anxious for peace. May I not raise a toast, bid fortune to the fencers, and mark this day with something gentle?
Claudius (speaking) Sweet Gertrude, wait—do not drink!
Gertrude (speaking) And why, my king? Shall I not honor our son, your stepson, with the blessing of a mother’s heart? Hamlet—this for you! The cup to your good health!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, what need have you of wine? The contest is but begun—a breath, a moment, and all may change.
Gertrude (speaking) My Hamlet, let a mother’s cheer ring truer than any trumpet. If I sit silent, fear will eat me. Drink brings solace, or at least forgetfulness.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, I pray thee—
Gertrude (speaking) You seem disquieted, husband. Is it not the custom to celebrate in such times? Or do you look for omens where there are only shadows? (thinking) Why does his voice falter, his face pale so? There’s nothing in the world to make a wife more uneasy than a husband’s trembling.
Laertes (speaking) My lady, spare your toast, if you please. There is urgency in every drop tonight.
Gertrude (speaking) My dear Laertes, fear not—I drink to your honor as well. You bear your father in your heart, just as I hold mine close.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, something troubles you—I see it now. Let this moment pass unmarked; let words wait for silence.
Gertrude (speaking) My son, I would give you the world if it would bring you ease. This wine—may it quench the worries that choke us all.
Claudius (speaking) Do not taste it—Gertrude—
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, all this fuss for a single sip? Am I a child, to be warned away from harmless pleasures? (thinking) How oddly earnest he is—does he imagine death in every cup? Surely he misjudges the world.
Osric (speaking) Her majesty honors both with her drink.
Horatio (speaking) Madam, your grace shines brighter than the sun this hour.
Gertrude (speaking) Let this toast be memory—of simpler days, and laughter I can scarce recall. I drink… to hope, to peace, to children safe from pain. (thinking) The taste is bitter—strange—but I have known bitterness before. No matter, the moment must be filled with courage.
Claudius (speaking) She faints! See, she sways—
Gertrude (speaking) (thinking) My hands are cold, a numbness working up my wrist—the hall grows dim, figures wavering. What is this sudden weariness overtaking me? The wine… a fire in my veins. This cannot be—could there be ill intent?
Horatio (speaking) Fetch help! The queen is unwell!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother—speak to me! What ails you?
Gertrude (speaking) (thinking) Hamlet bends to me, his face pale as linen. I want to wipe the sweat from his brow, reassure him—why can I not speak with ease? The tongue grows heavy, the words stumble. My limbs are shackled by lead.
Gertrude (speaking) The wine—the wine—I… did not see… oh, my son, my son… (thinking) The world flickers. Fear takes root. Have I been… led here? Trapped by carelessness, or was it always meant thus?
Claudius (speaking) Support her! Give the queen air!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! What did you drink?
Gertrude (speaking) (thinking) I reach for Hamlet—my boy, always lost and hunted. Have I failed you? Did I never see what lurked beneath all this civility, the currents of hate? If I could, I would hold him close one last time.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not grieve, Hamlet. My heart… for you… only…
Laertes (speaking) The drink—the king’s toasting cup—O, treachery!
Hamlet (speaking) Speak, mother! What did you sense? What did you suffer?
Gertrude (speaking) (thinking) My vision narrows—a tunnel of light and then… only sparkles in the haze. The aches within multiply, wrestling in my chest and throat. Is this fear, or is it death? But what did I fear, in the end? Losing a child… that is a greater poison than wine.
Gertrude (speaking) Forgive me, Hamlet—if I… never saw… all you suffered. Your father… your grief… (thinking) I taste the air, blood thick in my mouth. It aches, this small letting go. The world narrows, circles closing.
Claudius (speaking) The queen—my dear queen—
Gertrude (speaking) (thinking) Yet, as darkness closes, I see his outline, Hamlet’s sorrow imprinted sharper than any jewel. Laertes, too—how young, how lost. The world made villains of children.
Gertrude (speaking) Remember me… not as queen—but mother. *(thinking)* The last breath shudders. Am I leaving so much unsaid? I wish I had—years more—minutes. One more lullaby.
Horatio (speaking) She dies! The queen is dead!
Hamlet (speaking) O, heart, break! Mother—let not your spirit depart without my love trailing behind!
Gertrude (thinking) The cold crawls higher, but I recall swaddling Hamlet, his baby hands, his whisper in the dark. The years scatter like leaves; what do they amount to but love and regret entwined? Was it truly fate that guided me to this moment? Or my own blindness?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet… be safe. Trust none… remember me… remember—
Claudius (speaking) This is disaster—she was innocent in all!
Hamlet (speaking) Innocent—but caught in snares spun for others. Is there justice in this?
Gertrude (thinking) My eyelids flutter—the murmurs are far, voices echoing as if from underwater. There are flowers, perhaps; a memory of gentle hands brushing my hair. The shouts, the clash of swords, the stench of fear—they fade except for warmth, love, pain—are they not all the same, in the end?
Gertrude (speaking) The cup… was poison… (thinking) I left my life not knowing all, understanding less. Too late, I see the patterns, the cruel edges of choice. I never meant to hurt. My Hamlet—be free.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Be comforted! Your love endures—
Gertrude (thinking) The world flickers. I see, in some distant place, a younger me, full of hope. Had I chosen differently, would we all have escaped this fate? Or was I always bound to this poisoned chalice, held to my lips by unseen hands?
Gertrude (speaking) Farewell… my child… my king… my husband… (thinking) Sleep overtakes me. At last, fear falls away. Only forgiveness remains.
Horatio (speaking) Angels sing thee to rest, gracious lady.
Laertes (speaking) Noble queen… peace now.
Gertrude (thinking) Darkness enfolds—the stage recedes. Hearts will break, storms will rage, but I—at last—am unafraid. My story ends in sorrow, accidental but absolute. Forgive. Remember. Love. 
Gertrude (speaking) Sleep, Hamlet—sleep safe. (thinking) The silence is soft—final—and through it all, love endures."
worried,Gertrude joins Claudius in concern over Hamlet's erratic actions.,"The royal couple has grown increasingly anxious, joining together in their concern as Hamlet’s behavior grows more and more unpredictable.
Gertrude (thinking)
How thin the air feels now in these halls, every echo of his footstep a sharp pang in my chest. Hamlet, my son, what fears stalk you through Elsinore's cold corridors? Have I failed you so gravely? Claudius grows restless—in his eyes, suspicion churns, but his brow is not so furrowed as my own. I must not let this worry show, for if I falter, there may be naught to hold us together.
Gertrude (speaking)
My lord, have you seen him again—this morning, just before the dawn broke? I waited, hopeful for a gentle word, but instead, I found my son’s chambers empty and his cloak torn upon the stair. What does this portend, Claudius? For each day he retreats further from us, lost in some dark maze of thought or fantasy. I hardly know his face of late.
Claudius (speaking)
My dearest Gertrude, your worry carves deep lines in your sweet countenance, and rightly so, for his mind is restless as the wild sea. Last eve he spoke to shadows, not men, railing at unseen foes. ‘Twas as though he argued with Death itself. I fear his reason’s unraveled.
Gertrude (speaking)
Unraveled? It pains me to hear such words spoken of my only son. Perhaps it is mourning, still—his father’s sudden death, our marriage, the endless clicking of tongues in every corner of the castle. I confess, Claudius, sometimes I wonder if I acted too soon. If my love for you has uprooted all that grounded him. Am I to blame?
Claudius (speaking)
Blame does not settle solely on you, Gertrude. The times are haunted, and grief has many guises. Yet Hamlet's grief festers; it is no simple sorrow. There is rage beneath it, and a cunning that chills my blood. His words are twisted riddles, barbs veiled in courtesy. He would make a puzzle of us all.
Gertrude (thinking)
Yes—he does twist every phrase, wields his words against us like swordplay. When I look into his eyes, I search for the boy I once rocked to sleep. I see only a storm gathering, and it frightens me—frightens me more than I dare say aloud. Is he mad, truly mad, or does he feign this frenzy for some inscrutable purpose? What have I done?
Gertrude (speaking)
Has he spoken to you of his heart, or revealed the root of his torment? Tell me everything, Claudius, I beg you. For if I am shut out from his world, there may yet be a way to return. A mother’s voice can reach where others cannot.
Claudius (speaking)
He met me in the garden yesternight and spoke of Denmark’s “rottenness,” as if our very reign were infected. He spoke in riddles—about playacting, masks, betrayal. I pressed him for candor, but he slipped the leash as always. There was accusation in every syllable, but never proof enough to grasp. He is too clever by half.
Gertrude (speaking)
My heart aches to hear that he speaks thus. “Rottenness”—what poisons him, Claudius? Is it us? The court is thick with whispers. I hear them in the tapestries, in the clatter of the servants’ heels. I’ve glimpsed Hamlet stalking the corridors at midnight, hand clutching cold stone, eyes ablaze as if pursuing some phantom foe. Sometimes I fear for his soul—sometimes, for ours.
Claudius (speaking)
Let us not forget what Polonius suggests, dearest—perhaps young Hamlet’s mind is tangled by love. He grows pale when Ophelia enters, yet as swiftly flushes red with scorn. Polonius would have us believe it is love-madness, yet I am not so sure. There is calculation in his gaze—as though he weighs the fates of us all in his palm.
Gertrude (speaking)
If it is love that torments him, then let us try bring balm to his wounds. If it is rage, then soothe him. Is there nothing we might do? Should I call him to me, beg him to trust his mother once again? I would humble myself before him—cast aside all pride—for the sake of his safety, and our peace.
Claudius (speaking)
Invite him, yes. Speak as a mother, not as queen. Perhaps your voice can reach through the madness, if madness it be. I will instruct the courtiers to keep their distance and their eyes discreet. Let there be only truth between you. Discover what festers in his soul, if you can.
Gertrude (thinking)
Truth. I am not so sure I know what truth looks like anymore—truth slips through these tapestried walls and twists its face. But if Hamlet holds some secret pain, I must bear it with him. I must be strong, though my own heart trembles. Oh, my son! Will you forgive me, will you let me inside your agony?
Gertrude (speaking)
Shall I send for Ophelia? Sometimes a gentle companion can soothe tempests that a parent cannot. Or does Hamlet resent her, too? I cannot read his heart, Claudius. I find myself at sea, battered by waves of fear and doubt. Guide me. If you see a path, I will take it.
Claudius (speaking)
Let us move cautiously, Gertrude. Polonius insists that we stage an encounter between Ophelia and Hamlet, watched in secrecy. Perhaps in observing them, we shall unravel this mystery. I do not know if I trust so public a stratagem, yet Polonius is ever confident. We must not drive Hamlet further into suspicion, nor into true madness.
Gertrude (speaking)
You speak wisely, my lord. I do not wish to be his gaoler. I will try to reach his heart as a mother—plainly, kindly. Yet every attempt seems to slip from my grasp. When I pressed him yesterday to speak, he turned away with bitter laughter, as though I were a stranger. How that laughter has wounded me. Have I lost him entirely?
Claudius (speaking)
Take heart, Gertrude. Even crows return to their nests; perhaps your son will return to your embrace by patient love. But I wonder, without remedy, how much longer we can risk his unpredictable moods. The court grows uneasy, and Denmark herself seems poised on the edge of unrest. 
Gertrude (thinking)
They all see it—this cloud that hangs over our house. Every time I catch Hamlet’s eye, I see accusation flicker there—and worse, disappointment. Have I betrayed my husband’s memory? Have I failed my child and my country in the same stroke? My hands tremble, yet I must command them to be steady. I cannot let him fall.
Gertrude (speaking)
Then perhaps action is required, not merely hopes and prayers. Let us send for Hamlet—together, as husband and wife, mother and king. If the state quakes for his sake, then let us show unity in our concern. Yet I beg you, Claudius, treat him gently. Do not summon guards, nor threaten force. He is still my son—our son.
Claudius (speaking)
Your mercy does you honor, Gertrude. Very well, I shall send for him. Let us hope that kindness will not be met with scorn. And if all else fails, perhaps the players who come to court—that travelling troupe—will draw Hamlet from his gloom. The arts succeed where we, in our failings, do not.
Gertrude (speaking)
Yes, the players. He always loved their antics as a child… I remember his laughter echoing through these great halls, brighter than the sunlight. Oh, if only I could return to those days—before shadows stole his joy, before my choices forged our present wound. I will wait here for him, Claudius. Send him to me. I must try once more.
Claudius (speaking)
As you wish, my queen. I shall see to it myself. Be brave, Gertrude. We are united in this, come what may. 
Gertrude (thinking)
Alone now. The hush thickens around me. My hands are icy, my breath shallow. The air tastes of fear—fear for Hamlet, fear for myself. What will I find in his eyes when the door opens? Blame? Fury? Or that desperate, pleading sadness that haunts me in my dreams? My heart batters against my ribs. I have rehearsed speeches in my mind, arguments and entreaties, but all crumble now, replaced by longing: just let him speak to me, truly speak, as a son to a mother.
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet… come to me, please. I am here. I will wait as long as it takes. My heart—I give it wholly into your keeping, though you break it over and over. Just show me the path to healing, and I will take it, even if it means undoing every choice I have made.
(There is a long pause. The sound of footsteps echoes in the corridor beyond.)
Gertrude (thinking)
He comes. His steps are uneven, slow. Is it hope or dread that makes me quake? There is so much unsaid between us… so much pain. Please, let this not end as all our meetings now do—in silences too sharp to bear, in words that bruise instead of soothe. I will be the mother he needs, or perish in the trying.
(The door creaks open, but before Hamlet enters—)
Gertrude (speaking)
Before you come in, Hamlet—know this: I love you. Whatever troubles you carry, you do not bear them alone. My arms are open if you will trust them.
(The door closes behind Hamlet. Fade to black.)"
"unaware, trusting","During the fencing match, Gertrude drinks from the poisoned goblet and is killed by the poison.","During the fencing match, Gertrude drinks from the poisoned goblet and is killed by the poison.
Gertrude (thinking) The hall feels alive with the clang of blades, the breath of so many gathered for this sport, not war. My Hamlet — his face, so dear, so pale with worry — is taken by the dance of duel. Laertes, so skilled, seems both fierce and distracted. I sit here, heart pounding with a longing to see my son’s honor intact and my husband’s will satisfied. The goblets glitter temptingly on the table. I thirst, yes, but more, I long for peace for my family.
Hamlet (speaking) Good madam, how fares it with you? Does the match amuse, or does it trouble your gentle heart, seeing your son so wound in rivalry?
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, I confess I tremble somewhat, but I take my ease in the company and the festivity. This sport is not war, I remind myself, though the swords flash sharp. I am proud to witness my Hamlet, graceful even in contest.
Claudius (speaking) Sweet Gertrude, why not partake of refreshment? The heat of sport can pass even to the watchers. Here — a goblet, cooled and prepared for you.
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, my lord. You are ever attentive. The gold of the goblet catches the torchlight so prettily. Let it not be said I neglect your loving care.
Gertrude (thinking) He watches me, Claudius, his eyes fixed with expectation as I take the cup. He is generous today, almost too solicitous in his manner. My dry lips part; the taste is oddly metallic, but the wine is cool on my tongue.
Laertes (speaking) Have at you now, Hamlet! Art ready for the next pass? The prince dances lightly; I must keep wit as sharp as blade.
Hamlet (speaking) I am always ready for you, Laertes. Your honor guides your hand; I trust you.
Gertrude (speaking) To the fencers! May skill and fortune favor the bold, and peace abide among us, whatever the outcome.
Gertrude (thinking) My tongue tingles slightly, warm ripples flowing down my throat as I swallow the wine. Such a strange aftertaste. Is it nerves? Or perhaps I merely drank too quickly.
Claudius (speaking) Good Gertrude, how does the wine sit? You seem unsettled.
Gertrude (speaking) Only a passing breathlessness, perhaps — the joy of pride, or the closeness of the fire. I am well, my lord, do not concern yourself.
Osric (speaking) The match is close, Your Majesties, but Hamlet takes the first hit. The crowd is alive with cheers!
Gertrude (thinking) I try to smile, to join their exultation. The noise presses about me — laughter, shouts, the scrape of steel and velvet. But my head whirls gently, as if I have spun too quickly on the dance floor. My arms tingle, growing heavier. I must remain composed; a queen should never falter in the sight of her people.
Laertes (speaking) Another pass, good prince, the odds yet even between us.
Hamlet (speaking) I thank you, Laertes. Let us not draw blood in anger but end this with honor.
Gertrude (thinking) Every word becomes harder to fasten upon. The goblet — something about it. My eyes flicker to Claudius; he smiles at me, but I feel removed, distant. The wine’s chill now seems to burn, strange and strong, within my stomach, spidering outwards like icy threads.
Claudius (speaking) (to Hamlet) Remember your uncle's wager, Hamlet — win the next touch and you have doubled my hopes.
Hamlet (speaking) I shall do my best, my lord — but may men’s fates not hinge too much upon the whim of wager.
Gertrude (speaking) Well spoken, Hamlet. Our hearts, not coins, are staked today.
Gertrude (thinking) My heart flutters, frantic beneath my bodice. My vision blurs for an instant; faces swim before me, as if underwater. I reach for air with my breath but draw it shallow. Is it only excitement? Or something more insistent, sharp, that burrows inside me? I cling harder to my composure. To slip now would shame my boy.
Laertes (speaking) Hamlet, your guard! The next pass is yours if you seize it.
Hamlet (speaking) Come, Laertes, let us settle this match as friends before all.
Gertrude (speaking) (voice slightly trembling) Such gentlemen, both of you. Denmark is richer for such kindness.
Gertrude (thinking) My lips numb. I blink, panic fluttering behind my eyes. Something is wrong. The goblet — the wine — my mind jolts with a blurry suspicion, but I cannot focus long enough to untangle it. I will not alarm them. Still, my fingers fumble uselessly at the edge of the seat, desperate for something solid.
Claudius (speaking) (anxious, under breath) Gertrude, are you unwell, my heart? You pale at the cheeks.
Gertrude (speaking) (straining to be calm) Perhaps the excitement is too high for me. I will stay seated, only watch a moment longer.
Gertrude (thinking) My tongue grows thick, words sticking behind my teeth. The metal taste lingers, bitter and unfathomable. Why—why does Claudius look so anxious? My chest aches — it seizes, wringing breath from me. I want to call Hamlet, to cry out, but all that comes is a soft gasp. Poison? The word is a spark in the maze of my thought; it flickers, dies, returns. No — surely not. No one would— No, I must not believe it. Not yet.
Laertes (speaking) Hamlet, well met! The final pass is yours to claim.
Hamlet (speaking) I would not wish to best you, but I must accept the verdict of arms. Mother, do you see me?
Gertrude (speaking) (barely audible) Yes—yes, my son. Always.
Gertrude (thinking) My whole body is heavy now, the heat too much to bear. The edges of the hall dissolve into shadow, voices echoing curiously in my ears, distant as birdsong on a winter morning. I recall Hamlet as a boy, pressing wildflowers into my hands, his laughter bright and ringing. I would give anything to hear it once more, to shield him from pain. Claudius watches me, fear hidden behind the mask of a king.
Osric (speaking) Another point for Prince Hamlet! The crowd is in admiration!
Gertrude (speaking) (faint, to Hamlet) You do—so well—my dear boy. I am—so proud.
Gertrude (thinking) No breath. No strength. The room spins cruelly about me. My fingers grope for the goblet, knocking it to the ground with a soft chime. I taste blood and iron and something nameless and cruel. Help me. Someone. My body will not obey.
Claudius (speaking) (rushing to her) Gertrude! Sweet queen! What afflicts you?
Gertrude (speaking) (struggling, barely speaking) The drink... was it... meant for me? I... feel... so cold.
Gertrude (thinking) His face looms, the mask slipping for an instant. I see guilt. I see fear. Did he know? Is this my punishment? My fault for trusting? I reach for Hamlet but my hand tumbles uselessly to the side.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother? Dear mother, what ails you? Tell me, I beg you!
Gertrude (speaking) (painfully, barely audible) Oh Hamlet... beware... the cup... is poisoned...
Gertrude (thinking) The world ebbs away around me, dissolving into a swirling tide of darkness and regret. I wish I could cradle Hamlet’s head, as once I did when fever raged his brow. I wish I had seen more clearly. Claudius kneels beside me, but he is far away; all kindness burned away by betrayal.
Claudius (speaking) (voice cracking) What is this? My Gertrude, my dove — stay, do not leave!
Gertrude (thinking) Did he mean it for me? Or was I mere accident, unwitting guest in his plot? All my trust — wasted. I feel no anger, only a slow release, warmth blooming into numbness. I wish, I want — I wish...
Hamlet (speaking) My mother! Vile King! What hast thou done?
Laertes (speaking) (stricken) The queen swoons! Hold her! Is all lost — oh heaven, what have we wrought?
Gertrude (speaking) (in a thin whimper) Forgive me... Hamlet... forgive...
Gertrude (thinking) The voices recede, muffled by layers of water and velvet and silence. I hope Hamlet lives — I hope he knows. Even now. The taste of metal lingers, somewhere deep.
Osric (speaking) The queen—she dies! The poison has taken her!
Gertrude (speaking) (final breath) The drink—I am poisoned...
Gertrude (thinking) Cold. Darkness. My son. My heart grieves — then ebbs away, as gentle as the hush before dawn.
Hamlet (speaking) No! Mother! I will avenge thee — I swear it, by thy bitter cup, thy stolen breath!
Claudius (speaking) (shaken, panicked) This was not meant! She — oh gods, she—
Laertes (speaking) (weeping) We are all undone. Treachery everywhere, poison in every trust.
Gertrude (thinking) I float, at last, beyond the pain, beyond the ache of loss. Let them know — I loved. I did not know. Trust was my crime. Let Hamlet forgive.
Gertrude (speaking) (as a last whisper, barely perceptible) I loved...
Gertrude (thinking) And all is dark. The world hushes. The end, the end."
celebratory,Marries Claudius during the marriage celebration.,"The halls of Elsinore glimmer with candlelight and garlands as Gertrude marries Claudius during the marriage celebration.
Gertrude (thinking) The air thrums with music, laughter, and something else—anticipation, maybe a hint of unease perched just beneath my joy. What will Hamlet see in my eyes tonight? But this moment—this new bond—is mine to claim, for love or necessity. I must find my way through it.
Gertrude (speaking) Claudius, the night dances for us. I hear music in every breath—the court's joy sings all through these walls! Tell me—do you feel the world tilt in our favor?
Claudius (speaking) My queen, the world tilts, indeed. With you beside me, Elsinore stands taller and brighter than ever. With every cheer, every goblet raised, I feel the gods themselves smile on us. Gertrude, look about you—their happiness is for us alone.
Gertrude (thinking) He always knows the right words. Even so, I sense Hamlet in the shadows—his eyes sharper than any blade. Should I call for him? Should I reach for my son on this day meant for new promises?
Gertrude (speaking) Where is Hamlet? Have you seen him, Claudius? It matters to me—to us—that he stand with us tonight. This is a new beginning for us all.
Claudius (speaking) My dearest Gertrude, Hamlet lingers in melancholy, straying from celebration. Let the boy grieve in his manner. Time will soften his sorrow, and in time he will come to accept our joy.
Polonius (speaking) Majesties! The nobles look on with such delight. The wine flows, the minstrels play, and Danes rejoice in your union. Might I offer a word—nay, a wish—for peace and harmony forever in your marriage.
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, good Polonius. Your well-wishes are a balm and a blessing. I hope all voices echo yours tonight. We gather not just for love but for Denmark, for its steady heart and bright future.
Polonius (speaking) Indeed, your Majesty. The realm is heartened by your strength. After dark days, the light of your union returns fortune to us all.
Gertrude (thinking) Fortune. The word nearly startles me, for fortune is fickle, as I have well learned. Still, tonight fortune feels smooth as silk—at least for a moment.
Gertrude (speaking) Claudius, hold my hand. Let us walk together among our friends and kin—let none doubt the unity that crowns Denmark tonight.
Claudius (speaking) As you command, my queen. Let us make of this night a memory golden and unbroken.
(Hamlet enters, remaining on the periphery.)
Gertrude (speaking) There you are, Hamlet! I thought the sweet lure of music must draw you, even through sorrow. Would you not join us, my son?
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, I see joy has conquered mourning here. Your garlands still glimmer with morning’s dew and yet seem woven from yesterday’s funeral flowers.
Gertrude (thinking) His words press at old wounds, sharp and cold. My boy—how deep does grief run? If only he could see my heart, divided and trembling.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, I loved your father. I loved him as fiercely as a woman can—but he is gone, and life must go on. Tonight, let us cherish what remains. Won't you give this peace—to me, to yourself?
Hamlet (speaking) Peace, mother? It seems the only thing changing with seasons here are the names atop the throne—and the hands that hold yours.
Gertrude (speaking) You wound me, Hamlet, yet I forgive you. We are bound by circumstance and flesh, by tears and vows. Will you not at least offer blessing, if not your presence?
Hamlet (speaking) My blessing would amount to little, but I shall stay, if only to honor the memory you so swiftly lay to rest.
Claudius (speaking) Hamlet, your presence brings honor beyond measure. In time, you will see as we do—the kingdom’s need for unity, for a father’s firm hand beside your mother’s gracious rule.
Gertrude (thinking) How carefully Claudius arranges his words, as though each is a steppingstone toward Hamlet’s forgiveness. Still, I sense the crackling beneath Hamlet’s pride—pain and longing together.
Gertrude (speaking) Let us not cast shadows where there is so much light, my dear ones. Come—toast with us. Let the wine warm your heart, just for this night. What matters sorrow when hope is new?
Hamlet (speaking) Hope is a fragile thing, mother, but for you, I shall try to raise its battered wings.
Gertrude (speaking) That is all I ask, dearest. All any mother can wish for her child.
(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern approach, beaming.)
Rosencrantz (speaking) Majesties, the whole court stands ready to honor you both! Your marriage is spoken of in every chamber as a sign of Denmark’s rising fortune.
Guildenstern (speaking) Never have we seen such celebration in these halls! The musicians are breathless, the servants dizzy with excitement, and every heart beats like a drum in your honor.
Gertrude (speaking) Sweet friends, your words restore my own spirit, tired as it is by loss and longing. Tonight, let us press aside the past and take joy in what might yet be born anew.
Rosencrantz (speaking) We shall dance and drink until joy is a living thing, majesty!
Gertrude (thinking) Their laughter rings like chimes, careless and young. If only all wounds could be healed with laughter—if only all doubts could fall away at the promise of a future.
Gertrude (speaking) Dance, friends! Dance until your feet ache and your hearts are content!
Polonius (speaking) Hear, hear! Such a night deserves a thousand songs. Shall I propose a toast?
Claudius (speaking) Speak, Polonius! Let your words bless this house.
Polonius (speaking) To our most gracious Queen Gertrude, whose strength has weathered storms fierce and sorrow deep—and to our noble King Claudius, whose wisdom and valor now guide our destiny. May your union be the cornerstone of lasting peace and unyielding prosperity!
All (speaking) To the Queen and King!
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, friends, for hearts so full and voices so true. If Denmark flourishes, it is because her people choose joy over doom, hope over despair.
Claudius (speaking) The Queen has spoken with her usual grace—let all remember this night, when sorrow was set aside for hope, and hope for promise.
(Horatio, standing with Hamlet, interjects softly.)
Horatio (speaking) Your Majesty, may I offer a quiet blessing? For Hamlet’s heart and yours—may your union bring him some measure of comfort, too.
Gertrude (thinking) Horatio—kind, sensible soul. He sees behind Hamlet’s ice, wishes for healing, not division.
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, Horatio. You are a friend to both Prince and Queen, and your gentle words are treasure in a world so harsh.
Hamlet (speaking) Horatio speaks more than any gilded tongue here.
(Location shifts to a smaller group as the celebration continues.)
Gertrude (speaking) Claudius, walk with me—let us find some quiet. These crowds, for all their gaiety, press upon my senses.
Claudius (speaking) Of course, Gertrude. Let us withdraw for a breath—this moment belongs to us alone, after all.
(They move aside onto a balcony overlooking the hall.)
Gertrude (thinking) The air is cool here—sweet relief. My hand in his, my heart wavering between joy and regret. I have chosen this path. For myself. For Denmark.
Gertrude (speaking) The cheers, the music—they fill me, yet also leave me hollow in places I rarely show. Claudius, do you ever fear the ghosts of our choices?
Claudius (speaking) I will not lie, Gertrude. The past lingers as shadows always do. But I see only strength in your eyes—renewal. Together we banish the ghosts. We write our own story.
Gertrude (speaking) And if our story is written atop another’s grave—does that not curse us?
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, the living shape the world. The dead cannot. We take what we must, for the sake of crown, country, and—yes—our own trembling hearts. I love you. Isn’t that enough, tonight?
Gertrude (thinking) He loves me—and I him, in a way born of loneliness and desire, of power and the unwilling need to survive. Tonight, perhaps it is enough.
Gertrude (speaking) Tonight, it must be enough. Tomorrow—let us not think of tomorrow.
Claudius (speaking) Then let us seal this night with a promise. A promise stronger than death, clearer than old regrets.
Gertrude (speaking) I promise, Claudius—to stand by you, for Denmark, for the dream we piece together, shard by gleaming shard.
Claudius (speaking) And I, my queen, promise strength where you feel doubt, laughter where you feel anguish, love where you fear only loneliness.
Gertrude (thinking) My heart beats loud with his words. Maybe fortune will smile, maybe fate will turn—tonight, I am alive, desired, crowned.
Gertrude (speaking) Then come, husband. The revels await us, and I wish the world to know this love is no accident of fate, but a choice. Our choice.
Claudius (speaking) As you will, my queen. Let us return—let them see us unbroken by grief, dazzling in our rule.
(They step back into the grand hall, arms entwined. The celebration surges anew.)
Gertrude (speaking) Dearest lords and ladies—let the festivities not wane! Drink, dance, salute the future we claim tonight! Tonight I am not only wife or queen—but woman, alive, opening my arms to the future.
(The crowd erupts in cheers.)
Ophelia (speaking) Majesty, you shine with such radiance tonight. The court looks to you and feels hope anew. I wish you every happiness.
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, gentle Ophelia. Your kindness fills even the quietest corners of my heart. I trust you will find joy in the days to come as well.
Hamlet (speaking) Happiness is a tricky god, mother—it blesses some, passes over others. But I will not darken your night; dance and be glad.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, my son, know that my heart beats always for you, even as it finds new rhythm beside Claudius. You—and your father—are never forgotten.
Horatio (speaking) The Queen’s heart is large enough for all Denmark, Hamlet. Peace, if you can take it.
Gertrude (thinking) If only words could heal all wounds, and love could smooth the jagged edge of what we’ve done. Tonight, I must believe it can. Tonight I will let joy win, and grief be silent.
Gertrude (speaking) Come, all—one last dance, before midnight steals this moment away!
(The musicians begin a lively tune. The celebration swells, the court alive with spinning colors and laughter.)
Gertrude (thinking) I am wife, queen, and mother; beloved, scorned, doubted—and yet, joyous, daring the future to try me. My choices are my own. I will claim this night before the tides shift once more.
Gertrude (speaking) Let us drink to Denmark—old sorrows gone, new dreams to follow! With courage, with love, let our voices fill the night!
(The candles gleam, the music soars, and Gertrude stands at the center of it all—resolute, radiant, alive.)"
"flustered, guilty",Becomes extremely upset by Hamlet's veiled accusations during the play.,"The background: Gertrude becomes extremely upset by Hamlet's veiled accusations during the play.
Gertrude (thinking) What is he trying to do? Each look, each word of his carries such a double meaning. My heart pounds loud enough to deafen me. Does he suspect? Can he see through me? The lights flicker on the faces around us, but I feel only heat—shame, guilt, fear—all at once. I cannot meet his eye for fear he will see it written there. Why must he gaze at me so?
Hamlet (speaking) Madam, how like you this play?
Gertrude (speaking) The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
Hamlet (speaking) Oh, but she speaks what she feels, madam: will you not admit as much? She mirrors some among us who too quickly affirm innocence.
Gertrude (thinking) Every word he throws is barbed. The play, the queen within it—does he mean to accuse me openly? Does he mock my vows to his father? This cannot be a mere entertainment. My throat tightens. My own son, to corner me so.
Claudius (speaking) What means your majesty, Gertrude? You turn so pale.
Gertrude (speaking) The air is thick, my lord. I find it hard to breathe.
Hamlet (speaking) Perhaps the action offends the soul’s memory, mother. Or perhaps the breath is choked by conscience.
Gertrude (thinking) My God, what have I done, that he must look at me such a way? My hands tremble; I cannot hide it. Is he telling the court my secrets? Is he convincing them with his silent accusations that I have betrayed his father, and worse?
Claudius (speaking) Hamlet, you press your mother too hard. The play’s meant to be light—yet you turn it heavy.
Hamlet (speaking) The play’s the thing, sir, to catch the conscience of a king. Or a queen, perhaps.
Gertrude (thinking) No—he cannot know. And yet his eyes say he does. I cannot silence my heart; it pounds with guilt. I feel exposed, like all see through the veneer, see the truth I try to hide beneath silks and smiles. My own son’s tongue is sharper than any blade.
Gertrude (speaking) You take too much upon yourself, Hamlet! You mistake the play’s meaning.
Hamlet (speaking) I mistake nothing, madam. The meaning is plain if only our eyes would see. Guilt blanches faces more surely than any spectre.
Gertrude (thinking) He seeks to drive me mad, just as he has driven himself to folly. Why must he do this in public, before all eyes? My own shame consumes me; I would flee if only I could rise without collapsing.
Polonius (speaking) My lady, let us withdraw if it pleasure you. The evening grows unsettling.
Gertrude (speaking) No, I… I am well. It is but the heat and strain of so much spectacle.
Hamlet (speaking) The strain of feigned feeling, perhaps. Or the weight of unconfessed sins.
Gertrude (thinking) If he names my deed, I am lost. I am undone. Everyone will know. Does he seek to ruin me? Does he hate me so deeply, my son whom I bore in pain and loved in innocence? Why this torment?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, your meaning twists sharper than the play’s own daggers. Can a son speak such riddles to his mother, and not tear her heart?
Hamlet (speaking) A son’s heart aches when a mother weds in haste, and tramples memory. Tell me, madam—how is the second wedding banquet sweeter than the first funeral feast?
Gertrude (thinking) His cruelty is too much. But is it cruelty, or accusation deserved? How could I have married Claudius so quickly? What madness swept me? I wanted comfort. I wanted to not be alone in the darkness of night, frightened by old ghosts—real and imagined. My own reasons, so tangled. Are they so vile in his eyes? I feel his judgment burn through me.
Gertrude (speaking) You shame your mother with such talk. You know not my heart, Hamlet, nor the wounds within it. You misjudge.
Hamlet (speaking) The wounds are clear, mother, and the blame is clearer still to those who dare look. The play makes all plain: a wife takes poison not in drink, but with kisses. 
Gertrude (thinking) His gaze will undo me. I can bear this no more. My hands grip the arms of my chair so tight my rings cut into my flesh. I cannot cry—not here—not in front of them. I must hold the queen’s mask, even as my spirit crumbles. Does he truly suspect I was complicit in his father’s fall? Or is it the speed of my new vows that he condemns?
Claudius (speaking) Enough, Hamlet! Attend the play, and speak not in riddles to your mother.
Gertrude (speaking) Yes, heed your uncle’s—your father’s—wishes. Enough, my son. I cannot endure your suspicions this night.
Hamlet (speaking) My father’s wishes, yes. His spirit lingers, I think, most potently this night.
Gertrude (thinking) Ghost. Always the ghost in this dark castle. Am I haunted? Is it so? Each night my dreams are visited by eyes—his eyes—unblinking, accusing, sorrowful. Now Hamlet wears those same eyes.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, your words and looks alike are daggers. What would you have me do? Confess to crimes I do not know? Reject my husband? Cast myself into the abyss to please you?
Hamlet (speaking) I would have you look into your soul and tremble if you find there cause. If not, sleep easy. But if so, let your heart break as mine is broken.
Gertrude (thinking) My heart is wrenched, split between terror and love, between the man I chose and the son I bore. I feel sick—unseen by the eyes of the court, my soul is raw, bleeding. Has the world always been so cold? Or have I made it so with my deeds?
Polonius (speaking) My lady, the play nears its tragic end. Shall I call for wine to cool your brow?
Gertrude (speaking) No, let the scene play out. There is no comfort in wine tonight.
Hamlet (speaking) The scene is played already. The rest is silence.
Gertrude (thinking) Silence. If only I had remained silent, not hurried to Claudius’s bed, not welcomed his arms so soon. If only I could seize the midnight and undo, unmake, unbind all that history now chains to me.
Gertrude (speaking) If there is fault in me, Hamlet, only Heaven can judge it. Not you. Not this cruel play.
Hamlet (speaking) Heaven sees, mother. Hell suspects.
Gertrude (thinking) Is this my son before me, or Fate’s punishing hand? My breath stutters. I am suffocating on shame; yet pride wars in me still. I am Queen. I must not shatter. But my hands, my heart, rebel.
Claudius (speaking) My dear, let us leave. This night’s shadow grows too long.
Gertrude (speaking) Yes. I must—go. I cannot bear the stage nor the eyes that fasten on my soul.
Hamlet (speaking) I beg you, madam: confront not the outward show, but the inward self. That is where all our tragedies begin.
Gertrude (thinking) He knows. He sees through all the finery—straight into my guilt, my longing, my loss. The walls close in. Perhaps after, in privacy, I can call him to me—plead, explain, beg for forgiveness he may never give.
Hamlet (speaking) I pray you, mother, leave us now. I have said enough.
Claudius (speaking) Come, Gertrude.
Gertrude (speaking) I will go. But know, Hamlet—your words wound where shadow already dwells.
Gertrude (thinking) I stumble as I rise. Claudius supports me, but his touch is foreign now—cold where once it brought comfort. My son’s eyes follow me with accusation, sorrow, condemnation. I feel everyone’s eyes. I am exposed, guilty, desperate for escape. Still I must walk, shoulders squared, head held high, mask in place. Inside, I am undone. Inside, all is chaos. If only—if only—my heart is breaking."
"angry, interrogative",Summons Hamlet to her room to berate him for his insinuations.,"Background: Gertrude has summoned Hamlet to her chamber to confront him, livid over his recent insinuations regarding her actions and motives.
Gertrude (thinking) The gall of this son of mine—his tongue runs too freely, weaving poison in every word. Today, I will not allow his accusations to fester without answer. He must understand the rage I harbor, the pain his suspicion breeds. I am queen, I am mother, and I will not be interrogated by my own blood.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet! Do not feign ignorance. You know well why I have brought you here. On my very threshold, you have scattered rumors, hinting at shame and foul deeds done by me. How dare you—how dare you, my son—so publicly doubt my honor and love!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, what honor have you left? You trade words as quickly as you’ve changed husbands. I see what is plain: My father’s shadow yet lingers and you—You, who should have cherished his memory—rush to Claudius’ bed as if one king’s corpse is but a feather to be swept aside.
Gertrude (thinking) Insolent boy! He wields his grief as a bludgeon, blind to the needs of the living. I have borne more than he can imagine—and now he questions not only my choices but my loyalty, my very soul.
Gertrude (speaking) Flaunt not your sorrow as wisdom, Hamlet! You know nothing of the wounds I suffered—nothing of how a heart battered by grief grasps for what comfort it may. Must a widow live forever in shadow? Would you have me rot, cold and alone in mourning? Claudius is king—was I to deny the blood and power of Denmark its due?
Hamlet (speaking) You were to remain true! The bonds between my father and you were holy, sanctified. Have you no shame, to leap from mourning veil to wedding garland within a month? Speak truth, mother. Was it love for Claudius, or mere ambition?
Gertrude (thinking) He hurls words like stones, but he knows nothing of the emptiness that followed the king’s death. My own heart, shrouded in confusion, gravitated to the only anchor left—the one trusted by my late husband, the one on whom Denmark now depends. Is it so contemptible to seek survival amid chaos?
Gertrude (speaking) Ambition—do you accuse me of ambition? Your father’s crown weighs heavily on mortal hands! I found no joy in his death, nor relish in a crown passed to my new husband. I chose Claudius not for love, nor hunger for power, but because our realm demanded it—stability, Hamlet! Without a queen beside him, the king is vulnerable, the state exposed. Would you rather see Denmark torn asunder by strife and foreign plots?
Hamlet (speaking) Stability? Or the soft comfort of a familiar arm, the ease of privilege never lost? You protect the realm by forswearing your own virtue, mother? Or is it only yourself you rescued from grief?
Gertrude (thinking) He reduces my anguish to selfishness—never pausing to consider the sacrifices demanded of me. If only he knew what it is to hold both love and nation in trembling hands… No more, Gertrude! Stand firm.
Gertrude (speaking) You make mockery of my pain. You judge me, but could you shoulder what I have borne? Would you, left alone as queen, cut off from all allies, choose to live a pariah, a figure shrouded in endless grief while the eyes of Denmark watch for any weakness? You speak of loyalty while wielding hate like a dagger.
Hamlet (speaking) I wield only truth. Or have my words struck too near the heart, mother? Do not mistake anger for lies—you know you have erred. How, in mere weeks, do you so thoroughly forget my father? His memory demands more than tears in passing. Or is conscience so easily soothed by power and pleasure?
Gertrude (thinking) My son sees phantoms, jealousy twinned with sorrow. He cannot conceive how woman’s loyalty is not a prison, nor that sorrow may ache for more than sanctity. My blood—my boy—be damned if I let him tear me apart with such accusations.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough! You claim to serve your father’s memory, yet all you sow is discord and distrust. I must mourn as a queen as well as wife, Hamlet! Your father is gone—he cannot return, no matter how you rage or whom you blame. Why must you torture me, drive wedges between myself and the man your father trusted most?
Hamlet (speaking) Because you have betrayed him! Or does betrayal need a sword and not a wedding ring? Have you no remorse—no sense of the treachery you have abetted? I see you, Gertrude—mother or not, queen or not—I see how quickly you bend, how little you resist what is easy or expected.
Gertrude (thinking) His invective, his scorn—they burn, but I have been tempered in flames greater than his. What does he know of loneliness, expectation, the chill that settles on a throne denied of warmth? I chose as I must. He will listen, this time, or he will feel the sharpness of my tongue.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not presume to know my heart, Hamlet! You, with your morose airs and self-righteous sorrow, see only what you wish. I have carried burdens you never will. Fear, isolation, whispers in darkened halls—whilst you chase phantoms, I fight for the throne, for myself, for you, my son, for Denmark! Do not cross me again with talk of shame and sin—were you in my place, I wonder if you would remain so blameless.
Hamlet (speaking) I ask only for honesty, mother. Can you give it? Can you look me in the eyes and tell me you did not rush to Claudius’ bed, that the warmth you gave him was not at the expense of virtue or my father’s ghost?
Gertrude (thinking) Honesty—he seeks confession or condemnation. Yet what truth would satisfy his fury? He demands purity where comfort was all that kept me from madness. Still, I must answer him, for so much hangs in the air—my motherhood, my queenship, my very soul at stake.
Gertrude (speaking) Pure truth, Hamlet? Here it is: I did not plot your father’s death, nor did I leap with glee to new marriage. I was lost—have you never known despair so utter it drowns you? Claudius was solace, yes; a presence, yes; in time, a husband. But I do not carry guilt for seeking a path through grief. If that is sin, then let the world judge me, but my conscience is clear. I will not wear sackcloth for you or your father’s specter.
Hamlet (speaking) So you admit it: your own suffering mattered more to you than your duties as wife and mother. You abandoned fidelity for the nearest comfort.
Gertrude (thinking) Heartless. Unyielding. Does he imagine widows must join the dead? I defended Denmark as fiercely as I have defended him. Let him hear me: raw, unbowed.
Gertrude (speaking) Think what you will, Hamlet! I will not apologize for surviving. For doing what is necessary—first as queen, then as woman, then as mother. If that offends you, curse away; but do not again cast poison on my name in public. You wound not just me—you imperil the unity of a country your father built, the safety you enjoy. Gossip and insinuation—you undermine everything your father labored to secure!
Hamlet (speaking) If unity is bought by deceit—by erasing my father from your heart—then what is Denmark worth? What legacy do you leave me, mother?
Gertrude (thinking) He wounds, drives words into flesh, twisting them until truth contorts beyond bearing. It was never erasure, never forgetting. Only survival, only trying to keep the world from burning under the weight of a dead king, a grieving queen, a restless prince.
Gertrude (speaking) My legacy is resilience, Hamlet! Denmark will not fall while I breathe, no matter what malice festers in its halls. Leave me to tend my own soul—I have kept this court from ruin, faced eyes eager to see me fail, and endured your scorn. Do not test me further. Filial piety does not give you license to poison your mother.
Hamlet (speaking) Nor does motherhood grant license to betray, Madame.
Gertrude (thinking) He is relentless, yet I will not yield. I feel the heat rise in my cheeks, the tremor in my hands, the sting of indignant tears. This must end. I will not be called to account by my own child, nor cowed into penance for having lived and chosen as I must.
Gertrude (speaking) Then let us mark this—between us alone. My heart aches for you, son, though you would see it shriveled. For love of you, I would endure any accusation, any pain. But I will not have my name dragged into the dirt for the satisfaction of your anger. Blame me if you must; judge me if you will. But know this—you are my son. I will not forsake you, no matter your wrath. Yet I will not keep explaining my grief to one who turns every word to a wound.
Hamlet (speaking) If wounds still bleed, it is because they are not healed, but hidden. Speak with me, or not, but know that my suspicions will not be quieted by empty assurances.
Gertrude (thinking) Suspicion, whispering behind every wall—does he mean to drive me mad? Let him follow his ghosts; I have spoken my truth. The rest is for fate and history to judge.
Gertrude (speaking) Go then, if you will, Hamlet. Seek answers in shadows, if that is where you find solace. My chamber is not a court, and I am not your accused. Know that I love you, desperately, angrily, as only a mother pushed past her patience can. No more accusations. No more poisonous doubts. I am done.
Hamlet (speaking) As you wish, madam. My grief will not be silenced, but I take my leave.
Gertrude (thinking) Gone, as suddenly as he arrived—leaving me raw, angry, yet somehow, beneath all, still longing for understanding. He is my son, my last true connection to a world before everything changed. But I cannot, and will not, walk in ashes for his peace.
Gertrude (speaking) (voice broken, yet tinged with steel) Remember that I loved your father as much as I love you. Let that be enough."
"distraught, convinced",Believes Hamlet is mad as she cannot see the ghost he speaks to.,"In her private chambers, Gertrude stands trembling, watching her son Hamlet converse with empty space, his words desperate—while she herself can see nothing, certain at last that her son’s mind has broken.
Gertrude (thinking) This cannot be the same boy I once held in my arms. Each day his words twist sharper, wild with grief and fury, but now—this is more than mere sorrow. I see the madness in his eyes, hear it in his desperate pleas to spirits unseen. I must summon all the reason that remains in me, yet my heart shudders with fear. What darkness has claimed him?
Hamlet (speaking) Look, how it steals away! My mother, you see nothing there? You do not see my father, standing right before us, eyes burning with grief?
Gertrude (speaking) Alas, Hamlet! To whom do you speak so wildly? There is nothing, nothing at all—no shape, no presence. Your words chill me to the bone. You speak to empty air!
Hamlet (speaking) Empty? Mother, do you not hear his voice? Do you not feel the stir of death, cold and pressing? He calls to me, bids me remember.
Gertrude (thinking) His look unsettles me—a gaze as fierce as winter. His voice cracks, frantic, and yet—what if I am wrong? What if in all my years I have turned my gaze aside from things terrible and true? But no, my eyes see plain walls. My ears bear only my own heart pounding.
Gertrude (speaking) I see nothing, hear nothing. Hamlet, you frighten me. Is this grief’s punishment? Has sorrow warped your mind so cruelly?
Hamlet (speaking) O gentle mother, my grief is not a madness! Say not I am mad. You wrong your eyes, not mine. Do you see nothing there, upon the very threshold?
Gertrude (speaking) Not so much as a breath, nor shadow, nor whisper. All is silent. Son, hear me! Rouse yourself from this fit. Cast aside these hallucinations, these fearful imaginings! You do but harm yourself.
Hamlet (speaking) Hallucinations, mother? What I see is more true than the blood in my veins. There, where your heart would refuse to look, stands my father’s ghost, clad in majesty, and his eyes command me still.
Gertrude (thinking) My heart trembles. Can such fire be feigned? Madness—or something more dreadful? If I speak sharply he grows more distant, yet my hands long to reach him, to pull him back from the gulf that widens each moment.
Gertrude (speaking) My dear, I beg you, cease these words! It is not your father you see—but phantasms conjured by your sick soul. You wage a war with shadows. Come, let me hold you. Let me heal you.
Hamlet (speaking) O mother, you would soothe me with a mother’s arms, yet I am set ablaze by truth. The truth you cannot see, or dare not see. I am not wild, not self-possessed, but charged with a duty you will not name.
Gertrude (speaking) What duty, Hamlet? What purpose drags you from your mother’s love? Speak plain, if you can.
Hamlet (speaking) Revenge, mother. Vengeance for a crime that stains this house—the murder of a king, my father! The ghost cries for justice, and only I can hear him.
Gertrude (thinking) Murder? Justice? My head spins. Since the king’s death all has been confusion, darkness upon darkness, but—this terror, these accusations—how can a son speak so to his own mother? I clutch at reason as if it were a branch over a storm.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough! You speak daggers! My soul cannot bear it. There is no ghost, there is no message, only the agony of remembrance. Hamlet, you frighten me. Your mind is undone.
Hamlet (speaking) Am I mad because I alone see the truth? Or are you blind because you cannot bear it? Mother, believe me: my mind is sharp as ice. Your stubborn denial wounds us both.
Gertrude (speaking) I do not deny my grief, nor my love for thee. But this—this specter you conjure—what is it but the fevered child of sorrow, the frost of night upon your thoughts? Who will stand by you, if not I?
Hamlet (speaking) My father stands by me, though only I can hear him. O mother, cast off that which shackles your soul. See what festers in the heart of Denmark, and in your own bed! For if I am mad, your blindness makes you deaf to thunder.
Gertrude (thinking) My skin prickles. His words have an edge I have never known. Is this how ruin begins—a crack in the mind, a wound in the family large enough to swallow us whole? If I cannot see his ghost, perhaps I have missed other truths as well.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, I love thee with all my heart, yet what you demand I cannot give. I cannot see as you see—cannot dwell in the company of ghosts. It is terror enough to watch you adrift, torn from the world by storm and vision.
Hamlet (speaking) If you cannot see, then I must walk this path alone. But remember—you are not blameless. You chose Claudius. You turned from my father’s memory. The ghost accuses not only me.
Gertrude (speaking) Spare me, Hamlet! My choices are my own—driven by necessity, not evil. If I have erred, have I not paid in sleepless nights? Do not burden me with phantoms. You are all I have left, my son.
Hamlet (thinking) She is unmoved. The ghost gives her no sign, only me. Is my father’s will satisfied by my misery? Must I press her harder, break her spirit, force her to see—though the cost may be her mind or mine?
Hamlet (speaking) You ask mercy, yet deny my suffering! I beg you, look within. If you cannot see him, then see the consequence of what has been done.
Gertrude (speaking) I see only my child, broken before me—riven by grief, hounded by invisible horrors. Let me help you, Hamlet! Let us seek counsel. The priests, the leeches—someone must know how to heal such wounds.
Hamlet (speaking) No priest or leech can mend what is rotten in Denmark! The cure you seek is not of herbs, nor prayers, but of justice.
Gertrude (thinking) Justice—he returns to it, as if the word itself were an incantation. There is bitterness in him, but also clarity—dangerous as a blade. If he acts on these visions, what might he do? I must try another way.
Gertrude (speaking) If justice is your aim, then let it be done through means understood by all—not through haunted eyes and whispering air. Share what you know. Trust in those who love you.
Hamlet (speaking) I have trusted, and been betrayed. My words tumble into the void. Only the ghost hears me.
Gertrude (speaking) The ghost is but a shadow, Hamlet! Shadows cannot comfort, nor guide, nor protect you. You have a mother—flesh and bone. Let me be your anchor, not these dreadful fantasies.
Hamlet (speaking) If I may not lean upon you, then so be it. My course is set. The ghost commands; I must obey.
Gertrude (thinking) What can I do? Each plea pushes him farther from me, deeper into his nightmare. The son I knew is gone, unreachable. I fear what he might become, and yet—I fear for myself as well. If he is mad, will he turn his madness against us all?
Gertrude (speaking) If you will not listen, I shall cry out to others. The court must know how dire your state. I will not stand by and let you consume yourself. This is not your father's will, nor heaven's.
Hamlet (speaking) Tell what you will, mother. Their ears are stuffed with gold. Kings and courtiers serve themselves, not truth. Only the dead are honest now.
Gertrude (speaking) How am I to save you, Hamlet, if you flee from the living into the arms of the dead?
Hamlet (speaking) You need not save me, mother. Save yourself. See—before all is lost.
Gertrude (thinking) He leaves now—storming from me. I shudder with the cold he’s left behind, and with dread tighter than any winter. It is not only his mind that is lost, but the peace of all our lives. There must be some way to heal this wound, to shield him and myself from further destruction. But what, when words and reason fail?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet—wait! I beg you, do not go. Stay with me. Let me hold you as in childhood, when sorrow was but a passing storm.
Hamlet (speaking) Childhood is gone, mother. The storm is here to stay.
Gertrude (thinking) The air seems heavier now, thick with the threat of disaster. If he believes only in ghosts—and I, in nothing but the ache of loss—what hope can there be for us? How shall mother and son find their way out of this nameless dark, from walls that echo only with grief and accusation?
Gertrude (speaking) O God—what have I done? What have we all done? Hamlet, wherever you go, know that I love thee still. Whatever ghosts haunt you, your suffering is my own.
Hamlet (speaking) Farewell, mother. Pray for me—if prayer can reach the ears of spirits or men.
Gertrude (thinking) Alone, utterly alone. Even as I believe him lost to madness, I cannot abandon hope—nor cease fearing what the next nightfall may bring. If only I could pierce the veil that divides his vision from mine, and see for myself the truth or the torment that claims my only son.
Gertrude (speaking) Heaven send us both mercy—before Denmark drowns in sorrow."
"tragic, mournful",Announces Ophelia's accidental drowning.,"The background: Gertrude stands in the shadowed court, summoned to report the grim fate of Ophelia’s accidental drowning.
Gertrude (thinking)  
How can a mother’s tongue say such things aloud—such things as steal the very air in a room and turn it to ice? My own hands tremble at the edges of this tale, as if it is I who have dropped the blossom from her hand, I who let her slip under. I see Ophelia now, drifting, her dress blooming like a shroud of lilies and maiden’s hair. If I speak it, it becomes true. Yet these men—her brother, the King, Hamlet perhaps lurking—must know.
Gertrude (speaking)  
There is a willow grows aslant a brook, that shows its hoar leaves in the glassy stream. Therewith fantastic garlands did she make of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples—those liberal shepherds give a grosser name, but our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them. With these she came to the brook. Her slender arms circled with chains of painted petals, she climbed to hang her garlands on the boughs leaning out over the mirror of water, and—oh, heavens—her foot caught in the yielding wood.
Laertes (speaking)  
Stop, my lady! Speak plain. Where is my sister? What is it you mean?
Gertrude (thinking)  
How young he is to receive this blow, still so sharp in his soldier’s coat, his cheek unscarred by grief. His voice trembles on the tightrope of hope, not yet ready to abandon it, to tumble into the void of knowing.
Gertrude (speaking)  
She fell. She fell onto the weeping willow’s trembling arm and down she dropped, her woven crowns trailing, petals loosed like prayers. The brook received her; her garments, heavy with their drink, spread wide, and for a while they bore her up, like a mermaid singing old ballads they say, as if she were one made for the water—born not for earth, but for the quiet drift under a domed sky.
Laertes (speaking)  
You stood by and saw this, my lady? None ran, none called for help? She sang, but no hand reached to save her?
Gertrude (thinking)  
How can I answer? Who here would grasp at what they do not wish to see? I was too distant, my heart too slow, my limbs heavy with the griefs of this house. Guilt presses me, its fingers cold at my nape. I had power, but not enough, not for this.
Gertrude (speaking)  
She did not cry out. Not a single shriek pierced the green hush. She simply drifted, her eyes fixed on gathering clouds overhead, her voice weaving stray notes—snatches of old rhymes, broken as the stem that cast her down. None saw until the current pulled her under, her song suddenly stilled, her hands opening, as if in benediction. She has been taken, Laertes, by the silent stream beneath the willow’s shadow.
Claudius (speaking)  
It was an accident, then? Or something else? You speak in such riddles that a man’s mind turns to suspicion, Lady Gertrude.
Gertrude (thinking)  
How he fears the truth—the King. There is blood on his hands he fears will stain this death too, a shadow cast from his own wrongs. His gaze pierces the telling, seeking scapegoat or solace.
Gertrude (speaking)  
I saw no malice, no hand at her back. Nature herself seemed conspiracy enough. The branch yielded as easily as a sigh. The brook’s grasp was gentle—no violence, no struggle, no sign of anything but sorrow. It is accident, I say. The world has weighed upon her heart and tipped her, unsuspecting, into the arms of death.
Laertes (speaking)  
No solace is in such words. My sister—so gentle—she is gone, gone in an unkind season. Why did none watch her, none keep her safe from herself or the water's call? I would have given my lifeblood to hold her hand upon that bank!
Gertrude (thinking)  
It cuts deeper than any blade, these accusations—deserved, undeserved. I am mother to none in this grief, neither to Hamlet nor Ophelia, nor even to myself. I am only an echo in these courts, a witness to dissolving beauty and innocence lost.
Gertrude (speaking)  
My son, Hamlet, drove her to distraction, but was she not already lost—to herself, to grief, to a world that offers little comfort to gentle souls? Would you blame me, or him, or all of Denmark’s gloom for what the brook has claimed? She is free now of her troubles, unchained from expectation and despair. We who remain must bear the sorrow.
Horatio (speaking)  
Lady, you paint a sad and haunting picture. Will the Queen herself see to her burial? Will there be rites for her?
Gertrude (thinking)  
The customs of men, their rites and their rules, they pale before the enormity of this loss. The priesthood would deny her song, calling it sin, but I see only innocence swept away by careless tragedy. I must fight for what little grace remains to offer her.
Gertrude (speaking)  
I will do all in my power to see her laid gentle in the earth, as gentle a girl as ever walked upon it. If the world’s laws falter, let a mother’s will be her shield. I shall scatter her garlands myself, ring her tomb with the petals she so dearly loved. If there is mercy in this cold land, let it fall upon her now.
Laertes (speaking)  
Let it be so, my lady. But what of Hamlet—does he know? Will he trouble her resting further?
Gertrude (thinking)  
Hamlet—my son, damaged and dangerous, bound yet to Ophelia’s fate as if to his own. If he learns her death, what storm will he unchain? Or will it at last break him, or redeem him?
Gertrude (speaking)  
No word has reached him in his exile; he wanders between madness and purpose. But the news will find him, as all sorrow finds its home. I will tell him myself, if I must. His grief must take its shape, and if it wounds anew, we must stand it as we may.
Claudius (speaking)  
Let there be care for the Queen—she has suffered much in these days. Laertes, I bid you hold your heart; vengeance stirs easily, but justice is slow. Ophelia shall have rites befitting her station.
Gertrude (thinking)  
He speaks as King now, not as kin, shoring the boundaries, masking fear with policy. Yet policy cannot stem the tides that run silent in all of us, nor can a crown keep out the river’s cold grasp.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Thank you, my lord. But let not words be all her sepulcher. Gather flowers—her favorites. Let the court wear mourning, not for a moment but for as long as her memory weighs upon our hearts. Make this a lesson, not a passing shadow.
Laertes (speaking)  
You have my thanks, Lady—though thanks are ashes in my mouth. Take me to her—let me see her, if the water has not effaced her loveliness.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The ruins that loss makes of us—see him now, armored only in grief. He wishes to cradle her as a child, to rewind time and bar her path to those drooping willow boughs. Yet nothing can unmake what is done.
Gertrude (speaking)  
She lies not far from here, swept to a gentle bank, her hair mingled with weeds and blossoms. I will take you there; come, Laertes. Let her face be the last that remains to you of innocence in Elsinore, and let us mourn her together. All that’s gentle we have lost—may we yet find it in memory.
Horatio (speaking)  
Would that such innocence had more defenders. I will go with you, in silence, and see her laid to peace.
Claudius (speaking)  
Let the court prepare. There will be rites for the fair Ophelia. Let no man speak lightly in her memory.
Gertrude (thinking)  
This is how the world unravels—petal by petal, heart by heart. I must carry the fragrance of her brief life into the gathering dusk, and hope some god who sees all children lost to water will receive her gently.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Let us go, then. The sun is slipping, and my arms ache for the weight of garlands. Ophelia, sweet child, we come—too late for saving, but not for farewell.
Laertes (speaking)  
Lead on—let the river witness our grief and bear it, as it bore her, to some quieter place.
Horatio (speaking)  
Your words shall be her monument, queenly and compassionate. I will walk behind, in respect.
Claudius (speaking)  
The court will do as is fitting. Let no tongue wag in idle speculation. The dignity of Denmark depends on it.
Gertrude (thinking)  
With every step, I feel the world growing heavier. If I could shield them all—Hamlet, Laertes, even Claudius—if I could turn back the waters…I would. But I am a woman made for mourning, it seems. Tonight, the brook shall have our tears, and Elsinore will ring with the silence of Ophelia’s song, stilled forever.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Let Ophelia go to her rest, covered in dew and gentle as morning. Let us bear witness and hold her among us until memory gives way to peace. Come, all.
Laertes (speaking)  
She will be mourned.
Horatio (speaking)  
She will be remembered.
Claudius (speaking)  
Let no more sadness come than must. The kingdom leans upon our strength.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Yet let us grieve. This, too, is strength—to be unafraid of sorrow, to honor the lost. This, I will do, for Ophelia, for us all.
(End of scene.)"
complacent,Gertrude marries Claudius soon after her husband's death.,"Following the sudden death of her husband, Gertrude weds Claudius in an expedited ceremony, the court still draped in mourning banners as celebrations commence.
Gertrude (thinking) There is an odd hush over the great hall—a mingling of shrouded sorrow and forced revelry. The banners still hang black; Hamlet’s face is grey, and yet my hand in Claudius’s is steadier than perhaps it ought to be. I wonder at myself, at my ease. Is it numbness—or a hidden relief? The world is watching. They might sneer or scorn, but I—I am content. Odd, that word, but the closest to my heart.
Claudius (speaking) My sweet Gertrude, how fair and radiant you are, even with the night’s cold grief so recent upon us. Let Denmark see that joy, yes, even after loss, may blossom quickly as the spring’s own violets.
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, you speak well. The world must have a face—one that smiles onward, ever onward, despite what shadows linger at its feet. I am content to see Denmark in steadier hands again, to see its king once more seated justly upon the throne. The people will forget their mourning soon enough.
Hamlet (speaking) So soon, mother? Is that what Denmark is, then, to you? A matter of faces, swiftly changed—of veils and smiles and wedding cakes where funeral meats but lately lay? I scarce know if I dream or wake.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, my son, I see you troubled. But pains of the past should not bind us. What is done is done. The state needs not our tears; it needs laughter, hope, unity. Would you have the whole country dressed in black for an age, lost to memory, crippled by vacancy? All lives, even a king’s, must yield to time. We must think of what remains—and what may blossom.
Claudius (speaking) Your mother speaks true, good Hamlet. The ship of state must always sail on—never to founder on rocks of old sorrow. Come, would you not rather Denmark thrive, its king awake, its queen comforted and sharing in all duties? I vowed to your father to love and guard you both. I shall keep it.
Hamlet (speaking) I think your vows come as easily as breath, uncle. As changeable as wind.
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet’s words sting, but what does he know of loneliness? What does he know of the chill that follows a king into the grave, the hour then when the world seems to fall away—except for one hand to steady you, a voice to call you forward? Claudius was there when all others withdrew. That must mean something. I feel no shame in comfort. Is that so wrong? I am alive—I wish to live.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, you are young still, and grief looms larger than life in youth. Time will show its mercy. And Claudius—he is a good man. He loved your father, too. He seeks only to keep us whole, all three together, as a family. Can you not let yourself see it for a little while, before the world tears us apart once more?
Polonius (speaking) Your Majesty Gertrude, you wax most wise. To mourn too long is to risk all Denmark’s peace. The common folk mirror their leaders. If they see joy, they will follow, and the kingdom will flourish again.
Gertrude (speaking) You are right, Polonius. The people need their queen’s smile, not her lament. They must believe in beginnings more than they mourn endings.
Ophelia (speaking) My lady, many speak of your fortitude already. My own father says your decision was wise, and most practical.
Gertrude (speaking) I value your words, gentle Ophelia. It is not easy, I know, for all eyes to watch and judge each breath I take. Yet I am untroubled. My heart is at rest; my duty fulfilled. The page has turned. Let them gossip, let them weep or scoff—their voices fall like rain; I will not be drowned.
Claudius (speaking) That is my queen. Resolute in the face of the world’s storms. Let us raise a cup: to union, to new fortunes, and to the peace of Denmark.
Gertrude (speaking) To peace, then—to a world that keeps turning, whether or not we wish it. To tomorrow’s sunlight, which cares nothing for yesterday’s queen or yesterday’s woes.
Hamlet (speaking) All is unseasoned to me, mother. Joy sits uneasy in a hall so freshly mourning. I see not peace in these colors, nor union, but something rotten near the root.
Gertrude (thinking) Poor Hamlet—he clings to phantoms. But sorrow cannot be the only tenant in our house. I will not shuffle among the ashes of what was, not when life, however altered, calls out for me. What do I owe the dead, truly, save remembrance? My living heart beats beside Claudius now. I would not turn from warmth.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, your tone wounds me. The hour is what it is; if you cannot find contentment, then at least grant your mother hers. I have lost much, but I refuse to lose myself. If that is a selfishness, then I claim it gladly.
Claudius (speaking) Let us not quarrel. The world needs healing after wounds—a gentle hand, a smiling face. Be reconciled, dear Hamlet. All is as it must be.
Hamlet (speaking) As it must, or as it is made to be?
Polonius (speaking) My prince, wisdom lies in acceptance. Majesty flourishes when sorrow is allowed to fade. Mark how Her Majesty radiates an example for the whole court.
Gertrude (thinking) Would they say this if it were any other woman—some merchant’s wife, a maid in the field? But queens must carry wounds in silence, dry their tears while ships are named after them and coins minted with their faces. I stand before them, dressed in pearls and dusk, guiltless. Why should I grieve forever when I can choose light, warmth, laughter at a new table?
Gertrude (speaking) Forgive me if I seem stern, son. But the world, as you see, spins whether we will it or not. I did not command your father’s death, nor my own heart’s emptiness after. Yet the kingdom cannot sit idle, nor can I. What solace would you offer me, Hamlet? Do you wish your mother to wither, alone in empty chambers and brittle memories?
Hamlet (speaking) I wish only for honor, mother—honor for the dead, justice for the living, and honesty for us all.
Claudius (speaking) And have we failed you on that count, Hamlet? Is love—a queen’s love, a king’s duty—so easily twisted in your eyes?
Gertrude (speaking) The past cannot rule forever over the present. I am weary of ghosts. It is not for me to sit beneath the shadow of a departed king until I vanish with him. I choose life—here, in this hall, with this man, with what future remains to me.
Ophelia (speaking) Your courage is apparent, my lady. Many whisper, but few would act with such certainty.
Gertrude (speaking) To hesitate is death of another kind, Ophelia. There is a time for mourning, but it must not last past the dawn. Every hour in shadow is an hour that might have been—laughter, heat, even folly, but something real, not just memory’s ashes. I would rather be whispered of than pitied in silence.
Claudius (speaking) Then let merriment begin. Gertrude, dearest, will you walk with me? Let them all see: Denmark’s strength is in its queen’s resolve—and her joy.
Gertrude (thinking) The room is brighter now. I see the old men whispering, the young ladies envying. Hamlet’s eyes are still pools of doubt, but he must learn. I have chosen, and I will not flinch from it. I am still young, in ways the world scarcely guesses. My blood stirs. The crown sits no heavier for the change of hands.
Gertrude (speaking) Yes, Claudius. I will walk with you, with my head high, beneath every gaze, every murmur. Perhaps the dead look on us with envy now—for we remain to taste the wine, to warm ourselves by the hearth. Let us live, and let living be no cause for shame.
Polonius (speaking) Well said, my queen. Denmark is heartened by your boldness.
Hamlet (speaking) The funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables, and still your words ring too easily on the ear, mother. But I am not the kingdom. The tide turns with its monarchs, not with me.
Gertrude (speaking) That is so, my son. The world moves on, with or without our consent. But better to move with it—better to seize joy than to let it slip away. I am not ashamed of comfort, not ashamed of need, nor of finding solace with Claudius. If that offends the world, so be it.
Claudius (speaking) You are wisdom embodied, Gertrude—and now, truly, my queen, my wife, and the hope of Denmark.
Gertrude (thinking) There it is—a steadiness within that I scarcely recognize as my own. It is not a surrender, but a claiming. The hall brims with light. I do not grieve, and I do not regret. The world expects trembling, but I feel none; only a certainty, as dazzling as the new crown upon my brow.
Gertrude (speaking) Then let dance and music chase away the old midnight. Let laughter rise like a tide, drowning tears and whispers alike. This is our hour—and I will not darken it for anyone.
Ophelia (speaking) Shall I fetch your cloak, my lady, for the dance?
Gertrude (speaking) No need, Ophelia. Tonight, I wish the world to see me clearly, and to see the queen, unshadowed, unafraid. Let the music begin.
Claudius (speaking) As you wish, my queen. Let joy be our answer to sorrow, and hope our answer to death.
Gertrude (thinking) The music stirs. My body remembers what it is to move, to breathe, to command a room not with sadness but with the simple act of being unbroken. I smile—not for show alone, but because I feel it inside, a thread of contentment winding quietly through me. The past is past; the present is mine. I will not beg forgiveness for surviving, nor for seeking happiness where I can. I am the queen—and I remain."
"flustered, defensive",Gertrude is upset by Hamlet's accusations of inconstancy during the play.,"Background: Gertrude is upset by Hamlet's accusations of inconstancy during the play.
Gertrude (thinking) His looks—sharp as knives—how he shames me, now, before all courtly eyes. My own son, drawing blood where I had always sought to love. Why must he accuse me so? Is my heart so inconstant as he claims, or is memory itself the traitor? My hands tremble, and I feel the eyes of Denmark upon my every breath.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, have you no mercy for your mother’s heart? You glare as if your eyes would scorch me, but what have I done to merit this wrath in full assembly? Must all your grievances flower upon my head like cruel thorns?
Hamlet (speaking) What have you done, madam? The very air we breathe is heavy with what you call “grievances”—but how quickly you forget. My father’s death, your hasty marriage, a wedding feast served on the heels of a funeral. You wear smiles where mourning clothes would rightly hang.
Gertrude (thinking) Sharper still. Each word a revelation of my supposed guilt. Does he see my soul laid bare—or only what his rage wishes to find?
Gertrude (speaking) Do not twist my weaknesses to daggers, Hamlet. The court whispers, but I am steadfast, not the harlot you paint me in front of them. My heart mourned your father—still mourns him. Cannot I seek some solace? Is every comfort I find charged as betrayal?
Hamlet (speaking) Solace, you say? When the bed still warm from my father bore his brother ere the earth was settled in his grave? Solace is not so easily won, mother. Methinks the world sees, plain as I do, the haste of your wedding.
Gertrude (thinking) Oh, that I could tear the certainty from his words! Would that I could explain the weight, the fear, the loneliness that pushes one toward embrace—even one so soon, so uncertain.
Gertrude (speaking) You see only haste, Hamlet, because you know not the dread that comes of long cold nights—shadows pressing, court hungry for direction, a woman surrounded by hungry eyes and sharpened tongues. Claudius offered safety. Is it so criminal to wish for shelter?
Hamlet (speaking) If safety were your sole wish, why wreathe it in smiles and laughter abed with my uncle? O, mother, did grief not demand more than convenient comfort? Did you not owe the ghost of my father something more than this parade?
Gertrude (speaking) Hush, you cannot know the emptiness, the longing, or the terror that haunted me. Left alone, pressed by counsel and threat—can a widow not act to shield herself and her kingdom? I have always chosen Denmark, Hamlet, even as my heart ached.
Hamlet (speaking) Denmark needed virtue, not expedience. The queen’s example is not merely her own—a mother’s trespass breeds corruption in every heart that looks to her.
Gertrude (thinking) How can he know? He’s never tasted fear of abandonment—never held a kingdom in trembling hands. My choices were not born of lust, but of necessity. Would that he believed me.
Gertrude (speaking) You are harsh, my son. Have you never erred in grief? I did what seemed right, buried under duty, trailed by sorrow. If love cannot pardon me, then let us be truthful before one another: I do not repent my choice, for it was the only one available.
Hamlet (speaking) Madam, sorrow makes monsters of us all, but must one descend so fully? Would a slower course not have saved something of your dignity and my father’s memory?
Gertrude (speaking) How easy for a son to speak of dignity—he has never had to barter between security and respect. My crown was at stake, Hamlet. My life. To hesitate would have been to court peril, for myself and for you. You would have been left more alone than I.
Hamlet (speaking) So you made your bed, you and Claudius. Your hopes for safety are plain—but at what cost, mother? When you lie down each night, do you sense him beside you, or do you feel my father’s absence? Does it haunt you?
Gertrude (thinking) He sees only black and white—loyalty or betrayal. My world has so many shades of grey. How can I confess regrets yet defend my right to survive?
Gertrude (speaking) Every night I feel the absence, Hamlet. Your father’s memory holds me—sometimes as cold comfort, sometimes as suffocating shroud. But I live. I carry on, for your sake, for the realm’s. If that makes me faithless, then call me so, but know I have acted out of more than desire.
Hamlet (speaking) I wish I could believe you, but the specter of your marriage chills the marrow in my veins. If survival demanded so much, why wed my father’s brother? No other soul in Denmark could preserve you?
Gertrude (speaking) Would you rather I had retreated to a convent, then? Abandoned the kingdom to factions and usurpers? My marriage was not only about me—it was about Denmark, about you.
Hamlet (speaking) There are other ways for a queen to serve. This... entanglement with Claudius stains us all.
Gertrude (speaking) Should I have let chaos reign? Let enemies sense weakness? Do you believe your father desired that? O, Hamlet, not all choices are simple. I am not proud, but I will not hide behind shame alone.
Hamlet (speaking) You speak of necessity, of sacrifice, but I see cowardice, or worse—ambition.
Gertrude (speaking) Perhaps you see as you must. But know this, Hamlet—your mother is not so easily defined. I have sinned in your eyes, but I have acted to protect what little can be salvaged from disaster.
Hamlet (speaking) Protection? Is that what this looks like—when I am left fatherless and you lie in my uncle’s arms?
Gertrude (thinking) My hands will not stop shaking. His words tear at me, but still I must defend myself—I cannot let him destroy me and himself in this fury.
Gertrude (speaking) Yes, protection—even if you refuse to see it. You see betrayal; I see strategy, preservation, the only weapons left to an aging queen in a nest of vipers.
Claudius (speaking) Peace, both of you! Your words echo through stone and hall alike. Gertrude, I never wished you distress; Hamlet, honor your mother, whatever resentments gnaw within.
Gertrude (thinking) He seeks only to diffuse, to control. But it is not his place—this is ours, mine and Hamlet’s. He cannot know the torments or the needs that led to this.
Gertrude (speaking) I do not require defense, Claudius. My struggle with Hamlet is not about your honor. This is a matter of spirit, of blood.
Hamlet (speaking) Then let us be plain: I will never understand your choice, mother. I am chained to my father’s memory, and every day it rots within me for what has been lost by your hand.
Gertrude (speaking) Would you have me undone, son? Stripped of title, of purpose, of shelter and cast to wolves—for virtue’s empty sake? We do as we must. One day, when you hold the crown, you will know the taste of such compromise.
Hamlet (speaking) I want no crown tainted by such bargains.
Gertrude (speaking) Yet you must take it, if you would save Denmark from faction and war. Just as I did what was required to keep some part of us—and the state—alive.
Hamlet (speaking) Duty does not excuse all sins. You may dress your choices in reason, call them necessary, but still, I grieve the mother I once thought I had.
Gertrude (thinking) He will not forgive me. Perhaps he should not. What lies between a mother and son—trust—once broken, cannot easily be mended, no matter the cost or cause.
Gertrude (speaking) I am sorry for your pain, Hamlet. I am sorry the world required so much of me and in turn asked too much of you. I hope, if nothing else, you see that beneath my crown, my heart still beats—a mother’s heart, battered, but not wholly turned to stone.
Hamlet (speaking) If you have that heart, show it now. Repent the marriage. Undo what has been done.
Gertrude (speaking) Would undoing it bring your father back? Or would it only break the fragile peace left in this place? I cannot undo the past, Hamlet. But I will try to restore some trust—if you can bear it.
Hamlet (speaking) We walk two different paths, mother. Perhaps our hearts, even at their fullest, cannot cross.
Gertrude (thinking) That may be so. But I will not give up—if there is still some thread unbroken between us, I will hold fast to it, for as long as I draw breath.
Gertrude (speaking) Then let us live with truth, Hamlet, however cold or comfortless. Perhaps one day, the world will be gentler—or we will learn to forgive.
Hamlet (speaking) I want nothing but honesty, mother. I have too long lived with shadows.
Gertrude (speaking) Then take my honesty now, though it comes wrapped in tears: I did not love Claudius as I loved your father. I do not rejoice in this union, nor am I proud. But I have lived under threat, fear, and counsel, and have chosen as best I could. May your heart find peace in that admission, if it can.
Hamlet (speaking) If nothing else, I see you now—as a woman, not just a mother or a queen. That must serve.
Claudius (speaking) Let these storms subside. Denmark needs both its Prince and its Queen.
Gertrude (thinking) My tears sting, my face is flush with shame and longing both. I have not cleared myself, but I have spoken true. If I can live with this naked honesty, perhaps Hamlet can meet me, wounded, but still my son.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough, for now. I thank you for your candor, Hamlet. Our wounds are deep, but so is the blood that binds us. Let us seek peace, or at least understanding.
Hamlet (speaking) We will try, mother. I cannot promise more.
Gertrude (thinking) He may never forgive, but I will not forsake hope. Even the bitterest truth must one day bear the possibility of reconciliation.
Gertrude (speaking) Then come, let us quit this cold scene. The court has feasted on enough of our pain.
Hamlet (speaking) As you wish, mother. I will follow—for now."
"angry, later remorseful","Gertrude calls Hamlet to her room to admonish him for his behavior, but is berated by Hamlet for marrying Claudius.","Gertrude has summoned Hamlet to her chamber in hopes of reprimanding him for his recent insolence, but once alone together, their confrontation unearths deep-seated wounds and bitter accusations over her marriage to Claudius.
Gertrude (thinking) My heart thrums with unease. Since my husband’s death—and this swift, new bond with Claudius—my son has been a stranger to me, wild and unkind. But love must still steer me. Tonight, I must command him to reason, before he drowns us both in discord.\nGertrude (speaking) Hamlet, sit. Do not avert your face. This night, you must hear me as your mother. Your father’s memory warrants your sorrow, yes, but these storms of manner, these open chidings, these jibes—do you not see how your grief returns upon itself? Speak, what cause have you for such anger?\nHamlet (speaking) Cause? Do you ask for cause, Madam? Shall I lay out the black ledger of betrayal before your jeweled feet? You would ask why I rail, why I wear this face of tempest? I’ll name it: marriage—a fortnight after my father’s bones were cold, you lay with his brother. Claudius.\nGertrude (thinking) He wounds with every word. Yet what truth swells beneath? I must quiet him, lest he cast his own soul into shadow.\nGertrude (speaking) Do you think me cold, so inhuman as to leap the chasm of grief to pleasure? It was necessity, Hamlet. The kingdom could not remain leaderless; Denmark’s crown is not a bauble to be toyed with until you please speak fairly again.\nHamlet (speaking) Necessity? Speak you thus of the heart, as if love and despair are matters of statecraft? I see but one reason for this haste—lust and ambition, not care. My father—my true father—barely gone, and you wed his brother, usurper upon usurper. Say it isn’t so. Swear it is not weakness.\nGertrude (thinking) How his voice cracks—how I’ve failed him. But there is no undoing what’s been done. Still, perhaps he can see the cost was not just his to bear.\nGertrude (speaking) I do not deny that sorrow has splintered us both, but you judge as if you know my heart. When I turn in the night, it is not peace I find beside Claudius—it’s the chill of absence. Your father’s shade haunts me too, Hamlet. I could not spend my life forever in mourning, paralyzing our nation in my grief. \nHamlet (speaking) Then why, mother, did you not choose solitude—or counsel? Why must you trade one king for another so quickly? Did you not sense the villagers’ whispers, the courtiers’ leer? Did you not feel their contempt pierce your skin? Or has the gold of the throne made your flesh insensate?\nGertrude (thinking) I will not let him wound me unguarded—still, I cannot bear much more. The shame he claims, it burns in me, too, a secret rot.\nGertrude (speaking) You presume much about what I feel. If shame is my lot, then know I live it daily. But men and women do not mourn alike. I was not made for cloisters and shrouds, Hamlet. Claudius offered comfort—and yes, rule—for Denmark’s sake, I thought it wise. You might have turned to me, but you instead spurned.\nHamlet (speaking) Comfort? Was it comfort you sought, or oblivion? Did you not see how Claudius crept at my father’s heels, how his ambitions slavered for the crown? Had your eyes fogged or your desire grown too thick for reason?\nGertrude (thinking) He cannot know—how can I explain it? That after long years of age and care, I too yearned for warmth. But am I a monster for finding life amidst death?\nGertrude (speaking) I am not made of stone. The castle pressed its silence on me, night after endless night, until even memories of your father’s breath faded. Is it sin to reach for a living hand? To yearn for the hush of loneliness to cease? What cruelty, that my own son should deny me solace.\nHamlet (speaking) Solace? You’d seek solace over justice? If my father’s ghost could speak, would he not curse this union? Would he not cry for vengeance? I have seen his spirit, mother—his lips tremble with accusation. “Foul and most unnatural,” he called it.\nGertrude (thinking) My hands tremble. Has it come to this? Mother and son speaking only wounds. O, did I know his mind so ill? Have I brought upon him more pain than death’s own work?\nGertrude (speaking) Cease! Speak not of ghosts and vengeance, Hamlet. Enough blood has watered these castle stones. You see what you wish, but you do not see me—a wife torn, a queen battered by nights of weeping. The kingdom could not wait for us to fracture further.\nHamlet (speaking) Let the kingdom burn, if virtue must be its cost! And I—your son—must I stand forever filthied by the quick forgetting of my father? Must I, daily, watch you glitter beside the man who covets his every gesture? Does filial love mean nothing? Has a mother no duty?\nGertrude (thinking) His rage scalds past sense. Yet my heart cannot steel itself against such hurt. He is still my child—lost, angry, wounded.\nGertrude (speaking) Am I to have no happiness? Are women’s hearts always to be bartered, our bodies seats of power and nothing more? It is easy, Hamlet, to scorn choices you’ve never been forced to make. Would you have me clutch at shadows, wither before your grieving eyes?\nHamlet (speaking) I would have you remember him, honor him! Not marry the serpent who shed his skin on our threshold. Have you no memories? No dreams left of old King Hamlet? Has Claudius so quickly smothered every echo of my father?\nGertrude (thinking) I see his hurt—a child clinging to the certainty of the past, certain only of loss. Yet I too grieve in my own, silent manner.\nGertrude (speaking) Your father sits with me in every hallway, fills the corners of my mirror. Claudius is not your father, Hamlet—I cannot erase that. But who are you to demand a life’s end with his? If every widow must die inside, where would Denmark be?\nHamlet (speaking) Denmark? Denmark is a feast for worms since his passing! All that remains is rot masked with festival. I see it, even if you do not. My schoolmates avoid my gaze, the palace rings hollow. If you will not call it sin, then call it cowardice—an unwillingness to bear the hard truths of grief. You have failed me. \nGertrude (thinking) Oh God, this pain—a spike through my heart’s marrow. My son, my son! Did I do so wrong? Or is this the cost for trying to survive when the world demands nothing but wretchedness?\nGertrude (speaking) I did not mean to fail you, Hamlet. I am sorry—I am so terribly sorry. If I could drag time back, I might have chosen differently. But I cannot unmake what is done. Am I beyond forgiveness?\nHamlet (speaking) Forgiveness? I do not know, mother. I see only what has been lost.\nGertrude (thinking) There—his voice, so brittle I imagine it might shatter on the chill. Guilt crawls over me, a serpent’s coil. I never wished to break him—never.\nGertrude (speaking) Then let us be broken together, Hamlet, at least for this night. I am your mother still. Let neither throne nor grave steal that from us. I confess my faults—do you truly think I loved your father so little as to forget him so soon?\nHamlet (speaking) No. Perhaps not, mother. It is only—I cannot reconcile what I see with what I remember. I thought love was stronger than death. That you—above all—would prove it so.\nGertrude (thinking) I see now—he needed something untouched by death, something pure. Forgive me for being, as all mortals are, so weak.\nGertrude (speaking) Love is not vanquished by grief, Hamlet. It is battered, changed—sometimes unrecognizable even to itself. I loved your father, as once I loved you as a child. Your anger is fair, and I will bear it, if it is what you must do to mend. Only know—my heart still beats, and that is why I am still here to speak with you now.\nHamlet (speaking) I—cannot speak further tonight. Let me go, mother. Your words wound but also soothe. I am lost. Perhaps I will never find my way again.\nGertrude (thinking) Let him go, Gertrude. Hold the ache within. This is penance. To love, to mourn, to fail—these are the threads in which we are caught. I must hope, somehow, that he will remember I was once his shelter, not his shame.\nGertrude (speaking) Then go, Hamlet. But know you are always my son. I will wait, as long as years require, to hear your voice again. Remember: even sorrow is love, in its fiercest form.\nHamlet (speaking) (quietly) Good night, mother. May our dead forgive what the living cannot.\n
Gertrude (thinking) He is gone—a shadow at the door. The room empties, leaving only memories and silence heavier than crowns. I am alone with my regrets, and with whatever hope remains."
"convinced of Hamlet's madness, frightened","Gertrude believes Hamlet is insane after he converses with the ghost, whom she cannot see.","The chamber is thick with tension as Hamlet, shaken and wild-eyed, finishes speaking to what seemed, to Gertrude, only empty air, while she remains unable to see the ghost that had so fervently seized Hamlet’s attention.
Gertrude (thinking) What darkness has fallen upon my son? The room is empty—nothing but shadows and the echo of his frantic voice. Oh, mercy—why does he speak so intently to the cold air? Is there truly something here unseen, or has my Hamlet’s mind slipped forever from him?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet! For heaven’s sake, whom dost thou address? There is no one—no one, do you hear? Art thou now so lost, so wrenched from thyself, that thou conjure spirits to answer thy unhinged heart?
Hamlet (speaking) 'Tis not madness, madam, nor conjuring of shadow! Look you, my mother, look! Saw you nothing there as the spirit faded? The air yet crackles where he stood!
Gertrude (speaking) My son, I saw nothing—nothing but your pale face wracked in terror, and your words tossed into the void. No presence but your own! 
What blights you so? Dear Hamlet, can you not see? 
Your very speech is rent—your eyes blaze at invisible forms. O prove to me you possess your senses still!
Hamlet (speaking) I am not mad! It is my soul that sees what yours cannot. My father’s ghost did appear—did speak to me, with eyes that burned with a dread beyond this earth!
If thou canst not see, at least believe there are such things as defy your understanding, madam.
Gertrude (thinking) He raves—he truly raves. His voice shakes with conviction, but to what purpose? If no ghost walks here but only his madness, what am I to do? If he is trapped in phantoms that only he perceives, how far might he go in frenzy? Am I—am I safe, even, alone with him?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, you frighten me! You ripple with unquiet spirits, yet there is none, none here but you and I. Why must your mind breed terrors to torture us both? 
You are changed, my son—there is a strangeness now that chills the marrow of my bones.
Hamlet (speaking) No strangeness but the truth, which men will label madness for their ease! There is rot here, mother, crawling beneath the walls, and spirits that press me onward. Would you call me mad because I see what should be seen?
Gertrude (speaking) Yes—yes, I fear I must! For what sense is there, when you fix your gaze on the empty air—muttering, pleading? My child, your reason is torn like a shroud. 
If there is no ghost and yet you speak to one, what hope is left for your mind’s safe return? Should I fetch help? Shall I call the guard, Hamlet?
Hamlet (speaking) You mistake me for a weakling, riven by fever or fancy. Yet know, my vision is true. Let the world call it madness, so long as justice is served.
It is you, mother, who must open your eyes. Your fear betrays you—would you rather blind yourself to all than accept the horror at our threshold?
Gertrude (thinking) My limbs are ice; terror thrums through me like a hunted doe. He stands there, speaking in riddles—his whole frame shudders with meaning meant for ghosts.
What now? If I balk, he may turn violent. If I console him, he may draw me into this abyss of delusion. Am I to be both his mother and jailer? Can I save him—or even myself?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, listen to me. For the peace of your soul and mine, I beg you—let us seek a physician, one learned in the ailments of the mind. All Denmark fears for you. I tremble even now as you look through me, not at me. 
Stay—do not roam these shadows alone. Let us call help—before it is too late.
Hamlet (speaking) I have no need of physic, but of justice. You ask for peace—yet peace shall not return to Denmark until the sickness at its heart is purged. Will you not see?
Must I play the madman so you feel safe in your illusion? What if the sickness lies closer than you wish to know?
Gertrude (speaking) These are but wild words, Hamlet—words that slice my heart! What is it you accuse me of? What have I done but love you, shield you, mourn your father as any widowed queen? 
If you possess reason enough, speak plainly! Or else—I cannot bear to see you thus, tormented by phantoms and driven toward some desperate fate.
Hamlet (speaking) My words are barbs, madam, but only to pry the truth from its shrouded bed. Didst thou not see? Didst thou not hear? My father’s spirit cried for vengeance—cried for blood!
But since you have ears only for comfort, and eyes only for the visible, perhaps it is best you doubt me. Perhaps my ‘madness’ serves us both.
Gertrude (thinking) Is this a threat, or only madness twisting at his tongue? I feel trapped. The torches flicker; his hands clench and unclench. Every pulse of his voice echoes with menace and sorrow. What is left for me? 
Run? Reason? Pray for deliverance? Oh, my child, my poor, poor child—who are you now?
Gertrude (speaking) Whatever haunts you, Hamlet, I cannot battle for you. If some invisible specter spurs you on, then know you fight alone. I am only your mother, weak and lost!
If my presence serves but to inflame your suffering, I shall go. But I beg you—be wary. These visions may destroy you—and then, what will be left for Denmark or for me? 
Please, Hamlet—let this madness pass.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, believe what you wish. If you cannot face the truth, then keep your blindness close. My path is set. Pray you, do not cross it.
Gertrude (thinking) His voice is iron now—unyielding. I am no longer his counsel, nor his comfort. He speaks to ghosts with more affection than to me. Is he utterly lost? There, the candle shivers; his shadow blots the wall like a monster loose.
I want to weep—but the tears clutch in my throat. Is this grief or terror? If I linger, will he turn on me? God preserve us all—who knows what his madness might birth?
Gertrude (speaking) Then I shall go, Hamlet. You refuse all guidance. Yet know this—whatever sights your eyes invent, or spirits trouble your ears, I have only ever loved you. 
My heart breaks to see you thus unmoored. But if I stay, I fear for us both. Farewell, my son.
Hamlet (speaking) Farewell, then. Remember me—but remember well, things are seldom only what they seem. Keep your prayers close, mother.
Gertrude (thinking) I move—each step heavy as stone dragged from some grave. The air feels colder as I pass him; his eyes burn, but not with a son's warmth. 
Is this the end of all my hopes for him? For myself? My feet carry me from the room, but some shadow of him seems to pursue. Down the corridor, each clanging echo is a toll for hope. Denmark lies under a pall, and my heart is gripped by a terror that may never unloose its claws.
Gertrude (speaking) I will pray, Hamlet, as I pray now for your peace and mine. 
Though the night is long, may the dawn bring light once more—to you, and to Denmark."
sorrowful,Gertrude reports that Ophelia has drowned while playing by the river.,"The willow trees bowed over the riverbank, their leaves veiling the tragic scene where Ophelia, adorned with wildflowers, had fallen and drowned as she played by the water’s edge.
Gertrude (thinking) The world feels colder, drenched in shadows since I witnessed the fragile joy of that poor girl turn so suddenly to grief. How will I bear the weight of this news? How shall I make those in this hall understand the innocence lost beneath those indifferent waters?
Gertrude (speaking) There is a willow grows aslant a brook, that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream. There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clambering up, poor Ophelia sat, her wildflowers woven and tumbling from her hands—she sang such snatches of old tunes, as though untouched by sorrow, as though the world bore no edge.
Queen’s Attendant (speaking) My lady, your voice trembles. Tell us, what befell the fair Ophelia? Does she linger still amongst the reeds?
Gertrude (speaking) (her voice cracking) She did lean out upon the slanted limbs, her arms full of crow-flowers, nettles, long purples. Her song rose clear, beneath the mutter of passing water, until—oh God—her garments heavy with water drank deep of the river’s secret. Still, she floated for a while, her dress expanded like a mermaid’s veil. She sang then, unknowing the danger, as one unmoored from hope.
Laertes (speaking) Speak, madam! Where is my sister? What strange story stirs upon your tongue? Why does my heart collect this storm?
Gertrude (speaking) O Laertes, bold in your anguish, shield yourself, for she is gone! At last her melodies gave way, her arms refused the surface, and the river claimed her, pulling down both weeds and bone. Your sister is drowned, fair Laertes—drowned and shattered against the silence of the stones. I saw the bright flowers drift after her, torn from her hands, claiming nothing but memory.
Laertes (speaking) Drowned! Cruel word. Drowned, and I here, shackled by grief and ignorance. How did this horror pass unwitnessed, unwarned? Who watched over her lonely passage on the stream?
Gertrude (thinking) Every syllable tastes of iron and loss. His heartbreak fills the chamber, gnaws at the edges of duty, of my own despair. I am prisoner of this sorrow. Yet I must tell it, plainly, until all understand.
Gertrude (speaking) The water lapped at her body, Laertes—first bearing her up, as though honoring her innocence, holding her lightly above the current. Yet sorrow is a weight, even for the river. Soon her song was lost, sunken beneath the water’s bitter hush. No one held her hand, no arm drew her back. She is gone where we cannot follow, not today.
Queen’s Attendant (speaking) Was it an accident, my lady? Did she slip, or did despair guide her feet unto that river’s mouth?
Gertrude (speaking) There is no answering with certainty, but I saw no fear in her song, only a drifting sadness, and perhaps the world’s indifference. Her mind was troubled—everybody here has seen it. But her last moments were not shrieks of fear, nor the recoiling of a child snatched by death. She went as if following the invitation of her own thoughts, a girl chasing a flower into stillness.
Laertes (speaking) My sister’s heart was shattered, as was my own—my father slain, my house undone. You say she sang—what melody, what words?
Gertrude (speaking) Old songs, broken and rethreaded. Some haunted remembrance of love cast aside, and some fragment from the reeds about the brook—a ghostly tune, neither laughter nor lament. I heard her lips form the name of her father, and a lover’s name lost to the wind, swallowed by the river before I could listen further. Her voice... I shall never forget that drifting lament—it will haunt these chambers.
Laertes (speaking) Why did none hear her? Why did none raise alarm, nor wade through water, nor pluck her from the clutching weeds?
Gertrude (speaking) The day was warm and bright. Her loneliness her only companion. When the cry finally rose, it was far too late. Those who came saw only the ripple of fabric beneath the silver skin of the brook, and the stilled hush of lilies white with ash.
Queen’s Attendant (speaking) What now, madam? How shall we mark this hour’s sorrow in the hall? How console the grieving brother, and how shield my lady from blame?
Gertrude (thinking) If only words could reverse the river—could float her small body to the shore, restore the brightness to her cheeks, unwind the burden of this hour. But the past is locked, and my tongue is prison.
Gertrude (speaking) We shall mourn her, rightly. The court will don its blackest veils, and the chapel will echo with the laments of those who held her dear. Let all know—a gentle soul was lost to us, not for crime nor failing nor folly, but for the pain this house has visited upon her, and upon us all.
Laertes (speaking) I shall not rest until I see her avenged—until the rot at the root of this palace is unmasked and laid bare for all to mourn.
Gertrude (speaking) Let no further harm come, Laertes. Sorrow is a fire lit anew with every word. Let us grieve—now—while her memory is gentle, while her song yet shivers in the willows. Poor Ophelia, she dreamt of love, yet waded alone into the slow forgetting of river and earth.
Queen’s Attendant (speaking) Is there peace for such as her, my lady? For one so young, so bruised by the blows of fate?
Gertrude (speaking) I hope there is—if not in this world, then in one far gentler, where water does not claim the innocent, nor madness seek out the gentle-hearted. If prayers mean aught, then let every candle burn tonight; let every voice carry her name, until sorrow gives way to soft remembrance.
Laertes (speaking) I would see her, madam. Take me to where the water holds her, or to where they have laid her down. I must look one last time—my sister, my blood.
Gertrude (thinking) His anguish cuts deeper than the frost beneath the willow. I cannot refuse him. To hold back this last farewell would be the final cruelty.
Gertrude (speaking) Come, Laertes. I will guide you. We shall walk past the gardens, beneath the arching limbs of willow, where the brook slows at the bank. There you’ll find her, shrouded in water lilies, her hands still twined with the flowers she loved so well. Make your peace there, if such a thing can be found.
Laertes (speaking) I thank you, though my thanks are hollow. When children are taken, when sorrow breeds sorrow, can there ever be true solace?
Gertrude (speaking) Solace is thin and cruel just now. Yet we must seek it, Laertes, lest grief consume all that remains. Ophelia would have wished for peace, even if she never found it here.
Queen’s Attendant (speaking) Shall I call the priests, my queen? Shall the bells toll at sundown?
Gertrude (speaking) Yes. Let the prayers rise on trembling voices. Let the whole court weep, that none may misunderstand the burden trembling in the heart of Denmark tonight. Prepare the white shroud, gather the wildflowers, sound the bells. We honor her best by treating her as one beloved, however the river’s judgment was rendered.
Laertes (speaking) If angry tears or vengeful words could raise her from the silt, I would give them freely. But there is only silence now, and the hush of water moving over bone.
Gertrude (thinking) Each word from Laertes is the echo of my own despair. My tongue falters. My eyes are heavy with grief and unshed apologies. I never wished for such an end, neither for her nor for the grieving world she leaves behind.
Gertrude (speaking) Let us go, Laertes. You and I—two souls made poorer by this day, but tied together by memory and love for she who is lost. Come. The willow weeps for her, as do we.
Laertes (speaking) Lead on, madam, for I have no vision left, but to follow where sorrow guides me.
Queen’s Attendant (speaking) The court shall wait in silence, and when you return, we shall be ready to mourn her as she deserves.
Gertrude (speaking) Let it be so. May the river of our sorrow not sweep us away, but draw us together, if only for this fragile hour.
(End of scene)"
"flustered, defensive",Is unsettled by Hamlet's accusations during the play.,"Background: Is unsettled by Hamlet's accusations during the play.
Gertrude (thinking) How dare Hamlet stare at me so, his eyes boring through as if he would see my secret heart? My hands tremble within my lap, though my face must not betray all that roils within. Claudius shifts in his chair beside me. I can feel his unease seep into my own limbs. The laughter in this hall has curdled to silence, the courtiers' eyes darting from Hamlet’s fevered face to mine, as if the whole court would see a guilty conscience painted in red upon my cheeks. He will not stop. The words of the play strike at me like arrows, and each one wounds anew. Yet I must not break here, not now. I am the Queen still.
Hamlet (speaking) Madam, how like you this play?
Gertrude (speaking) The lady protests too much—methinks she fears what should not be feared.
Hamlet (speaking) Indeed, lady? The play's the thing. You look pale, my Queen. Do you not see yourself reflected in the stage—your guilt, perhaps, made visible in the actors’ masks?
Gertrude (thinking) He twists the knife for all to see! Why must he press so? I cannot bear the weight of these insinuations before the whole court. Yet he is my son. Does he think me so frail? If I break, I betray myself. Must I defend my very soul upon this stage?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, your words are wild tonight. This play does but mirror fancies conjured from an overheated mind. Why must you vex your mother so before all her subjects?
Claudius (speaking) Hamlet, come, let the players finish. The hour grows late, and there is much to be done.
Hamlet (speaking) Nay, my lord, the best is yet to come. Pray, lady, is it not a wicked thing for a wife to so soon forget her former husband—to wed with all the speed of guilt, as though one grave could open conveniently into another marriage bed?
Gertrude (thinking) Is it madness in his eyes, or accusation? My face burns, but I must not lower my gaze. All eyes are upon me. Claudius’s hand finds mine, his fist cold, reassuranceless. I cannot defend myself without damning him, yet if I shield him, I risk my own damnation.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough, Hamlet! Your father is dead, but sorrow cannot become accusation. I loved him—how dare you charge me with forgetfulness, or worse? Would you have me lock myself away, a widow forever, rotting in silks? Is it a sin to crave companionship in life’s long years?
Polonius (speaking) My lord Hamlet, you go too far. The Queen would answer for herself, but she owes no explanation to you or any in attendance.
Hamlet (speaking) No explanation? This theater is truth. Let the Queen answer if she would—if she can.
Gertrude (thinking) Dear God, does he know? Does the shadow of his father’s ghost press upon him? My heart pounds so loudly I fear all must hear it. I must be calm. I cannot let him see me falter, whatever he believes.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, do you truly believe your mother harbors such blackened thoughts? Has grief so possessed your soul that you can see no motive but corruption, no action but betrayal?
Hamlet (speaking) I believe I see what lurks beneath the perfumed veil. I say no more.
Gertrude (thinking) His eyes; how they search me! I feel naked before my own son. Does he hope to wound me into confession? Must he stop my heart for the sake of his own peace? Yet if he would see guilt, he will find none confessed here—not in front of Denmark’s prying eyes.
Gertrude (speaking) You are cruel, Hamlet. You use the play for daggers, but I am not your enemy. Whatever suspicions you nurse, sheathe them. Your father is gone, yet I am still your mother.
Hamlet (speaking) A mother, yes, and yet— I pray you, answer honestly—when you look into your mirror, what face greets you? The widow weeping, or the Queen rejoicing in new wedlock?
Gertrude (thinking) He forces the very breath from my body. How shall I answer? My soul aches with the strain of standing so exposed. The court’s gaze, cold as iron, chills my spine. But I must not be seen to cower. Let him challenge me—let the truth shrive me.
Gertrude (speaking) Do you think I am made of stone, Hamlet, that tears do not come night by night? There is no ease for me in the wedding ring—I paid for it with every sigh that left my bed cold of your father. If you wish to judge me, let it be with a son’s compassion, not a stranger’s suspicion.
Hamlet (speaking) Compassion? Have you shown such to your own grief, or the King so swiftly lost? The player Queen in the pageant swore not to remarry. Would you swear the same, if the ghost of your conscience haunted you?
Gertrude (thinking) His words—he tugs at my every wound, exposes what I dare not name even to myself. Is it so shameful, to seek comfort in the living when death lies between? Still, in his face, I see accusation sharper than steel.
Gertrude (speaking) My vows were true—I loved your father as no woman ever could. But time devours us all, and I am but a woman, Hamlet, mortal, shivering in this cold palace of endless mourning. Is it so monstrous to yearn for warmth, for laughter once more?
Claudius (speaking) Hamlet, these questions verge on impiety. You forget yourself before your sovereigns.
Hamlet (speaking) Sovereigns? Or villains dressed in ermine and mask? Does the crown sanctify all, my lord?
Gertrude (thinking) They will tear us asunder, son against mother, husband against Queen. I must end this before our world crumbles under Hamlet's fury.
Gertrude (speaking) Please, Hamlet. Spare your mother’s heart before all these witnesses. I have not the strength to bear your coldness as well as your father’s tombstone. If you wish to speak, let it be in private—spare me public shame.
Hamlet (speaking) In private then, I shall come to your chamber when this play concludes. Then masks may fall.
Polonius (speaking) My lady, perchance the Prince suffers distemper. Shall I summon your physicians?
Gertrude (speaking) No, Polonius. Hamlet is not ill, save in his mourning. Let this chapter end, for the sake of all. I beg the company return to their pleasures and let shadows lie beneath the stage.
Ophelia (speaking) Your Majesty, would you have some drink, or ought I offer comfort?
Gertrude (thinking) Her kindness is a balm, but I can take nothing while Hamlet’s gaze burns me. My own breath comes in shallow sips; I must not faint beneath these lights. How I long to flee from prying eyes!
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, Ophelia, but I am quite content—only overcome, perhaps, by too much sorrow, and too little music. Let the musicians play, and let us remember joy.
Claudius (speaking) Well spoken, dear heart. Musicians! Strike up, and drown the silence.
Hamlet (speaking) Music cannot hush the voice of truth, nor pages drown the stain of deceit. But play on—let every note toll for the guilty.
Gertrude (thinking) Every word is a battle, every glance a wound. I must see Hamlet when the velvet falls, plead for clarity, for forgiveness, for anything but this terrible estrangement. Did I do so wrong? Was my love for Claudius a betrayal, or only a desperate grasp at life when all light had fled? I am Queen, yet tonight, I feel no stronger than a trembling girl upon her wedding night.
Gertrude (speaking) I will await you, Hamlet, when the play is done. Until then, I ask only silence—from you and from myself.
Hamlet (speaking) As you wish, madam.
Claudius (speaking) Come, Gertrude, let us take our leave. The night grows heavy with secrets best spoken in private.
Gertrude (thinking) I rise, my limbs reluctant, my mind racing. The court watches—will they remember my composure, or only Hamlet’s venom? Will I ever again look at my son and see love untainted by accusation? I must learn the truth behind his rage—or never know peace.
Gertrude (speaking) I go with you, my lord. Good night to all. Play on, that the hall may remember laughter rather than tears.
Polonius (speaking) Good night, your Majesties.
Ophelia (speaking) Sleep well, madam.
Hamlet (speaking) Good night, Queen. May conscience be your pillow.
Gertrude (thinking) His parting words haunt me as surely as any ghost. My very body aches from holding so much poised grief. I must prepare. I must be strong for what is to come. Alone, at last. Yet solitude brings no relief—
Gertrude (thinking) If only I could make him see— I am no monster, only a mother who could not bear the cold for the rest of her days. If this is guilt, let it be between me and Heaven. If he comes to me with daggers, let me answer with my true heart, whatever the cost."
"angered, frustrated",Calls Hamlet to her room to berate him for his insinuations after the play.,"After the tumultuous play in which Hamlet made scathing insinuations throughout, Gertrude summons her son to her private chamber, her anger simmering beneath the veneer of royal poise.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The air in this room thickens with accusation; my very blood boils to be called to account by my own child. He strikes and pecks and wounds me with questions that curdle the flesh on my bones. He will not do so unchallenged—not in these walls.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet! Enter, now, and stand before me as your mother commands. I have borne enough insolence for one evening. Your vile glances across the hall, your riddles sharp as daggers—did you hope I would not see? Did you wish to shame me before all of Denmark’s eyes? Speak! What have you to answer for your twisted entertainments?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, I did but mirror what is. The play exposes nothing but the truth that boils beneath this very roof—the festering rot of betrayal you would deny.
Gertrude (speaking)  
How dare you! You dare accuse me in riddles and charades, blushing not to poison my very reputation in public spectacle! You forget the line that separates son from sovereign, child from queen. You cross it again and again, my patience a rag to be wrung of every last drop.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Patience, yes. It seems all in Elsinore are adept at patience when the convenient lie makes life more comfortable. Perhaps you’d prefer I laugh and drink and clap my hands while deceit seethes through these walls—while my father’s image haunts the corridors unseen by you.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not speak to me of your father’s ghost! Do not conjure shades to bolster your grievances. You twist my every word into guilt, but what of your own? You hold all to account but yourself. If you sought pain, Hamlet, you have poured it deeper than you know.
Gertrude (thinking)  
He stares at me, his eyes wild, his tongue sharp—he is his father’s son, but twisted, broken by grief perhaps, or madness, or worse. Foolish child. Does he truly not know the cost I pay? The sleepless nights? The silences, the empty bed?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Pain? The well of pain is inexhaustible in this castle, mother. My grief is not a performance. I bleed, daily, for what was lost and for what you so quickly put aside. Can you not see that? Can you not see how swift your wedding, how raw the wound?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You presume to judge me, as if you know the contours of a widow’s heart! You have never known loneliness, Hamlet—not the way I have, not the chilling hollow that seeps through when the world abandons you. Do you think I leapt, giddy, to another’s arms? Do you think so little of me, your own mother?
Hamlet (speaking)  
I think... I think I do not know you anymore. The mother I cherished is drowned, it seems, in a sea of denial and silken lies.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough! You wound me with every careless word. I called you here so you might answer for your conduct—this cage of suspicion you construct not just around me, but around the very heart of state. Your play, your veiled threats—have you considered what ruin you court?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Ruin is already here, mother. It walks with whispers in darkened galleries. I only give voice to what all the world will soon see. Do not mistake warning for threat.
Gertrude (speaking)  
You presuppose you alone can see—blinded by your grief, by rage. What of your duty? Your name? You sully it, boy! You would tear down Elsinore itself to build a pyre for your grievances. For what? For justice? Or to feed the wretched fire in your soul?
Gertrude (thinking)  
I want nothing more than to take his face in my hands, to tell him I am still his mother, deserving of love, not this torrent of blame. But he will not hear it. His mind is a locked gate and I am left, knocking, bruised by my own child’s suspicion.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Let the truth burn if it must. It is better than this fog of lies. I will not let my father’s memory dissolve into nothingness while I am bid to smile and play the prince.
Gertrude (speaking)  
So you will turn Denmark upside down, betray your own blood, to what end? To slake your thirst for vengeance, to parade as martyr before the eyes of courtiers—the same courtiers who whisper now that their prince is mad?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Better mad than false. Better to be at war with the world than in complicity with corruption.
Gertrude (speaking)  
And do you call me corrupt? Your mother, who held you, who wept over your cot, fed you, shaped anew her whole life to make room for you? All forgotten, all erased by your suspicion?
Gertrude (thinking)  
He does not know what it is to be exposed, every breath watched, every word weighed as a weapon. He cannot understand the terror of being alone atop the throne, the decisions that bruise the heart and stain the conscience. It is not so simple as virtue or villainy.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I do not forget. But I will not let memory blind me to what is plain. You chose Claudius. You let him in. You...
Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough! You will not name your uncle in this room with such loathing, not before me. Whatever pain you nurse, do not lay that burden at my feet alone. The world moves forward, Hamlet—will you be dragged by it, or trampled beneath it?
Hamlet (speaking)  
I cannot march where I do not trust. I cannot obey where my heart is repulsed.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Then you will destroy us both! If you must cast me as enemy, then let us finish it here and now. Is that your will? To see your mother’s name blackened, her love discarded because you cannot stomach grief dressed in new robes?
Gertrude (thinking)  
What is this, if not the undoing of all that once tethered us? My child, my son—does he truly see me only as betrayer, never as woman writhing under burdens unseen?
Hamlet (speaking)  
I seek only truth. I wish you could look at yourself clearly. Perhaps it is not too late.
Gertrude (speaking)  
My reflection is warped by your accusations. I have no solace. Is it my fate to please all but myself, to be queen, mother, puppet, and villain by every turn of your tongue?
Hamlet (speaking)  
It is not fate. It is choice, mother. It always was.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Then mark my choice now: I will not be cowed by my own son, driven to despair in my own room. You will respect the crown—and, if not, then you will find the consequences of insubordination more real and bitter than any ghostly admonition.
Gertrude (thinking)  
I tremble, anger and grief locked in fresh war within me—how did it come to this? A mother must protect her child, but what if the child is the very blade at her throat?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Threaten as you will. There is nothing more you can take from me.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Arrogant wretch! If I have nothing left to lose, then I am more dangerous than you know. Beware, Hamlet—resentment, once awoken, does not easily sleep. You have chipped at my dignity. I will not bear it.
Gertrude (thinking)  
His jaw is set, pitiless; my heart aches with the love that curdles into anger. If only he would see me, truly, beyond the mask he has painted for me—yet he will not. I am cast, unwilling, as villain in his tragedy.
Hamlet (speaking)  
So be it, if it must. I serve not cruelty but truth, and will not stop for fear or favor—even if that truth hurts you.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Then expect no comfort from me. If you wish to carve your own heart from your chest, do not demand my tears to bathe it.
Gertrude (thinking)  
This room is smaller than ever, suffocating; the past is ghost-thick in the shadows. But I will not retreat. I will not yield. He is my son—but I am still Gertrude, queen, and I will not be unmade by a boy’s poisoned words."
"fearful, convinced",Believes Hamlet is mad as she sees him talking with nothing but air.,"As Gertrude stands trembling in her chamber, her eyes fixated on Hamlet, she witnesses her son speaking animatedly into the empty air, his countenance wild and changed—she is convinced beyond doubt that madness has claimed him.
Gertrude (thinking)
This is no passing shadow or adolescent grief—he truly speaks unto no one, his eyes wild with dread and awe. How his hands grasp at the air as though something invisible stands beside him! My heart beats so riotously I fear it may betray my terror to him. What curse has come upon my son? What terrible fate hounds him?
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet! Hamlet, dear boy, with whom do you converse? There is no one here—nothing but the silence of these stones. Oh, do not glare so! The very look of you chills my veins. Speak sense to me, child—what meaning have these ravings?
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother, do you not see him standing here? Do you not hear the dreadful voice that shakes my soul? Look—look where he points, his finger trembling with accusation—
Gertrude (thinking)
He flinches away from an empty corner, as though smitten by an unseen hand. Is there naught I can say or do to break the spell? What madness seizes the noble mind?
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet, there is naught here but air, naught but empty shade—no vision stands before us but your mother’s tears. I beseech you, my son, cast away such fantasies! These phantoms are mere conjurations of dark imaginings.
Hamlet (speaking)
You are blind, madam! Cold and blind! The vision stands even now—his wounds fresh, his visage grim—he calls for justice upon his murderer! You would have me deaf and dumb as you are.
Gertrude (thinking)
Dear heavens, how swiftly he turns upon me, suspicion and scorn in every syllable. What have I, his mother, done to merit such wrath? Oh, how lost I am in the wild of his mind!
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet, child of my flesh, you frighten me. Your words fall like thunder, yet I cannot find their cause. Do you not see how your speech undoes me? I shudder to be left alone with you, fearing what form your fever may next take. Give me your hand—let me feel the warmth, the living flesh—let me recall my son and not this stranger.
Hamlet (speaking)
Do not tremble so! My malady is proof against your comfort. The world reeks of rot, and you would perfume it with mother’s love. But I am haunted, madam—haunted, and cannot lay these ghosts to rest.
Gertrude (thinking)
I cannot understand the labyrinth of his sorrow, nor the meaning behind these wild accusations. How helpless it feels to be a mother, locked out from her son’s mind as from a bolted room.
Gertrude (speaking)
You see ghosts, Hamlet, where I see only shadows. Your spirit thrashes against nothingness, and in your despair, I fear you may do yourself harm—or worse, harm to me. Shall I call for help? Shall I summon men to watch over you this night?
Hamlet (speaking)
You would set your dogs upon me, then, to guard against what you refuse to believe? I am not a beast to be leashed in your chamber! If you cannot see the source of my torment, do not doubt that it tears at me all the more.
Gertrude (thinking)
What terror is greater than to lose a child thus—to watch his mind unravel and his love turn sharp and weaponed? If only I could call back the hours, undo the actions that have led us to this black hour.
Gertrude (speaking)
Oh, Hamlet, you speak daggers and they pierce me to the heart. I do not know this world you perceive, nor the tempests that rage inside you. Yet you are changed—so changed that I scarce recognize you. Tell me, how can your mother bring you peace? What would you have me say?
Hamlet (speaking)
Confess, madam—confess your crimes! Do not feign innocence. The bloody deed festers by your side as surely as my father’s spirit stands at your shoulder! Repent, and perhaps these horrors will let me rest.
Gertrude (thinking)
He speaks in riddles, but the venom in his tone is no child’s fancy. Crimes? Deeds? What would he drag into light from the murk of my memory? Can it be my hasty marriage—that celebration tainted now by his father’s sudden end? What guilt he heaps upon me!
Gertrude (speaking)
Stop! I cannot bear these accusations—your words scorch more than flames. What is it you would reveal? What secret convicts your mother?
Hamlet (speaking)
You shared your bed with a traitor, called my uncle “husband,” and spat upon the cold ashes of my father's love! Your conscience must howl at night, if you have any left at all.
Gertrude (thinking)
Every beat of my heart is now a drum of guilt. Does he truly believe I am party to such evil, or does this fever of the mind twist all things? I must steady myself, or else I too shall go mad.
Gertrude (speaking)
I am your mother—though you cast me as a villain, I have only ever loved you! If I have wronged your father with my haste, my soul is sorry. But these spectres you see—are they not creatures of your own grief, your own rage?
Hamlet (speaking)
Say what you will, mother—deny it, mask it, sweeten it with tender words. The truth shrieks louder than your protests. It will out—it will out, and all the world shall see!
Gertrude (thinking)
He is beyond my reach. Whatever words I conjure are powerless, the spell is upon him now and will not loose its grip. My fear is no longer for him alone, but for us both—for this path may end in madness or blood.
Gertrude (speaking)
If you will not turn from these shadows, then heaven help us both. What comfort can a mother bring, when her child raves at the night air and curses her with every breath? Shall I lock the doors, set guards at the thresholds? Or will you swear not to harm yourself, nor your mother?
Hamlet (speaking)
I am not mad! I do but see and speak what is true, though you would muzzle me and bind my sight. If I must be watched, then watch me—but know that it is the guilty that cannot sleep, not the innocent.
Gertrude (thinking)
It is hopeless. His conviction is unshakable, his fury a storm that will not abate. How proud and gentle he once was—now all kindness gone, replaced by suspicion and wrath. If this is what grief makes of a man, then heaven spare us all.
Gertrude (speaking)
If you will not be calmed, I must call for aid. You say you are not mad, but your every word is proof against you. Spare me further terror, Hamlet. For the love that once was between us, let this be the end of tonight’s anguish.
Hamlet (speaking)
Do as you must, madam; send in your watchers. But remember this night, and remember my words, for soon the truth shall blaze forth, and you shall see the ghosts that haunt me.
Gertrude (thinking)
There is nothing for it now but to summon help. My body shakes, my hands tremble so that I can scarcely reach for the bell. My son stands before me a stranger—his eyes wild, fixed on beings I cannot see. All is changed, all is ruined. May the dawn bring some reprieve, or failing that, a kind forgetting.
Gertrude (speaking)
Help! Ho, there! Guards! My son is unwell—bring light, and men, and comfort, that we may chase these shadows from his mind. Oh, Hamlet, forgive me—
Hamlet (speaking)
Cry out if you will—the truth cannot be silenced by frightened women and trembling men.
Gertrude (thinking)
He glares at me as if I were the heart of his torment, not the mother who bore him. My soul aches with terror and sorrow, for I do not know what night awaits us, nor how this tale may end. But one thing I know: my son is lost to me, swept up in a storm I cannot calm, and all the kingdom shudders with me."
"sorrowful, shocked",Announces that Ophelia has drowned while playing in a willow tree by the river.,"The sunlight filters tenderly through the willow's trailing leaves, glinting on the dark water below, where just moments ago Ophelia sang as she lingered among the slender branches, so near the river's gentle edge.
Gertrude (thinking) The world is changed in an instant. My heart is battered as I recall the girl's song—Ophelia, fragile child, the image of sorrow sculpted in youth. I have seen much in Elsinore, but this grief is too heavy for these old bones. I must find words, though voice may fail me.
Gertrude (speaking) Alas, sweet ladies—there is news I carry with trembling heart. Sorrow glistens in the air as dew upon grass, for Ophelia—our willow’s playmate and the light of her father’s memory—has fallen to the water’s clutch.
Laertes (speaking) What do you mean, my lady? Speak plain, I beg you, though anguish prick my ears. What has become of Ophelia? Why do you wear such bitterness in your tears?
Gertrude (speaking) I saw her, fair Ophelia, garlanded with wild flowers, drawing up her little coronet while perched upon a willow that leans out over the murmuring brook. The silvery branches cradled her as she twined violets among her fingers and sang some old, broken song—so sweet, so mournful, as the wind itself seemed to hush to hear her.
Queen (speaking) My lady, these words forebode a horror I dare not name. Is this poor girl hurt?
Gertrude (speaking) The willow’s branch, heavy with her weight and bowed with the burden of her sorrows, broke away. Down she tumbled, her arms still full of flowers, as though the earth itself sought to cradle her. The waters received her, her white dress blooming vast about her like a shroud of snow.
Laertes (speaking) No! Say not so! Has none pulled her out? Has help reached her—can breath yet fill her lips, or does she merely sleep upon the water?
Gertrude (speaking) She sang even as the ripples claimed her, wafting broken snatches of old ballads—her mind astray in sorrow, uncaring of her peril. For a while, her garments, buoyed by their air, bore her up, and she floated as one with the lilies, her fingers reaching but never seizing the shore. But, alas, as water soaked her clothes, heavy, pitiless, they pulled her down. She vanished, and the current swept her away, as if nature itself conspired to hide her from our sight.
Queen (speaking) O pitiful, heart-rending end! Could there be no rescue, no hand to haul her back to us? Was she alone in that moment—none to witness, save for you?
Gertrude (speaking) I was not alone, Your Majesty; the reeds and willows were voiceless sentinels, and I but glimpsed her as the end drew near. Fear clutched me frozen. Heralds ran for help, yet the river was silent, too swift, too greedy. Ophelia melted from the world as dew at sunrise, leaving not a trace but the floating petals of her ruined crown.
Laertes (speaking) Oh, woe that ever I was born to hear such horrors! My poor, dear sister! Was there nothing—nothing I might have done, had I been with her? What of the others—was none by her side, none to heed her cries?
Gertrude (speaking) Dear Laertes, her cries were not for herself but for lost loves, for her father, for innocence broken. She called not for help. She sang as if to lull herself to sleep, as though some gentler world awaited beneath the glassy depths. She drifted beyond reach before hope could quicken in our feet or voices swell in alarm.
Queen (speaking) I cannot bear the thought—her songs, her sweetness, her innocence gone. What comfort have we, now that spring’s fairest blossom has been harvested by the river’s hand? Did she look upon you in that hour, Gertrude? Did her eyes betray fear or peace?
Gertrude (thinking) Her eyes haunt me, wide and unblinking, the gaze of a child looking into an endless twilight. Peace mingled with longing, a desperate wish to unburden her soul. Can anything I say mend their hearts, my own shattered?
Gertrude (speaking) I saw not fear but a strange, sorrowful calm, as though she wandered in her mind to gentler meadows her feet could never find. Her eyes did not seek rescue, only rest, only flight from pain.
Laertes (speaking) I am undone—her suffering has shamed us all! Did no hand tend her loneliness? Am I brother, or am I wraith upon this earth, failing all whom I love? Madness consumes our house. Now my father lies cold, and my sister sways in the river’s hidden arms.
Gertrude (speaking) Blame not yourself, Laertes. The world conspired against her happiness. Each misfortune drove her further from the shore, her mind battered by grief till even the lily-anchored waters seemed safer than the stones of home. We are all broken, each in our fashion.
Queen (speaking) There is blood on all our hands. Broken laws, broken promises. Heaven will not smile upon us for this.
Laertes (speaking) I will go to the river’s edge! Take me there, my lady. If but I might collect one shred of her—her ribbon, her glove, her wreath—some token to mourn! Or must I wail with the willows, counting nothing but absence forevermore?
Gertrude (speaking) I will guide you, Laertes. The flower-choked bank keeps its sorrowful vigil. Wreaths drift where once her laughter rang. Yet I warn you—all the treasures you seek may only twist the knife anew. Her voice lingers, a ghost among the reeds. Come, let us weep together, lest sorrow swallow us apart.
Laertes (speaking) Lead on, my lady. Grief is my only companion now. I would not let her wander into the silent dark alone.
Queen (speaking) Go, both of you, and may mercy find you where comfort has failed. I remain, to pray that her soul, fleeing its bruised prison, finds solace on the far banks beyond our mortal gaze.
Gertrude (thinking) The castle, once alive with hope, seems now built of shadows. With each loss, my heart strains against its cage, seeking air, seeking absolution. I recall Ophelia’s small hands clutching flowers, envision them let loose beneath green water. Why must the innocent suffer most fiercely?
Gertrude (speaking) Laertes, this day the air itself bears testament to our failings. We are witnesses, helpless, to the world’s wayward currents. Let us bear each other up as mercy’s remnant. Let us go now. The lilies close upon what the living cannot mend.
Laertes (speaking) I needed her gentle counsel, her innocence, far more than revenge. The world is less for her loss, my heart emptier than all the echoing halls of Elsinore.
Gertrude (speaking) The silence left behind is ever deeper than the wound. Take my arm, Laertes. The world totters, but we must walk this valley together, or risk falling never to rise.
Laertes (speaking) The willow shall remember her, and so shall I. The river will carry my sorrow till seas run dry.
Queen (speaking) The bells shall toll, and I will shroud the court in black. But no color, no ritual, will ever suffice to mourn so pure a soul, lost to the madness of men and the indifference of nature.
Gertrude (thinking) How quickly youth is spent—a slip of a foot, a fracture of the mind—and all is irretrievable, lost among reeds and the green murmur of water. My own son’s shadow looms ahead, danger curling at his heels, and I am powerless to shield one child or the next from their sorrow. What world is this, when mothers can only witness and never save?
Gertrude (speaking) Come, Laertes.
Laertes (speaking) I follow, my heart ashore with hers, yet bound by grief to this weary earth.
Gertrude (thinking) My mind wails quieter than Laertes’s rage, but its ache is no less. Poor Ophelia—madness claimed you, and death completed the theft. Will the river forgive us, or will it flood Elsinore in righteous retribution for a daughter drowned, unheard, uncomforted? I walk the garden path in the shade of loss, the air sharp with funeral lilies and willow tears.
Gertrude (speaking) So ends one gentleness, one hope. Take what comfort you may in memory, Laertes, and may we find penance to pray upon, for soon our sorrows will rise like a tide and drown us, if we do not hold to one another. 
Laertes (speaking) So be it. Let us go. Let the river close over her, and upon my vengeance too. The willow bends for her, the castle for none.
Gertrude (thinking) This hour binds the living and the dead. If the river takes Ophelia, let our remembrance build her anew, untouchable by grief, set free in the memory of love.
Gertrude (speaking) Farewell, sweet girl, drowned in willow shade and river’s song. Let us be better, for your sake, though hope flees as swiftly as water.
Queen (speaking) Heaven has more need of her kindness than we. May the angels, if such there be, lay lilies on her breast where we could only lay our failings.
Gertrude (thinking) And so we drift, as she drifted, down sorrow’s stream, searching vainly for a solid shore that may never come.
Gertrude (speaking) Come, Laertes. The river will keep her secrets. We must carry on. Only memory is left to us."
"proud, celebratory","Gertrude drinks a toast to Hamlet from the poisoned cup, unaware of its contents.","In the grand hall, Gertrude drinks a toast to Hamlet from the poisoned cup, unaware of its contents.
Gertrude (thinking) This is a night the whole of Denmark will remember. My son stands before us, his mind and heart battered, yet he is here, and alive. No shadow of sorrow can darken this moment, not even the chill that lingers from recent grief. My husband smiles, the court is dressed in celebration, and Hamlet, my precious boy, is victor. In the sparkling music and gleaming lights, I see an end to discord—a chance for peace. Let me savor it and exalt him with every beat of my heart.
Claudius (speaking) Lords and ladies, raise your glasses! Tonight we pay tribute to the prince—Hamlet, our valiant son—who has returned from shadows darker than night. We bask together in the hope his courage rekindles. Drink, all, to Denmark’s future!
Gertrude (speaking) My lords, my ladies, all eyes still wet from tears—look now with pride. My son, Hamlet, struggled from the gloom, cast aside madness like a shroud. At last, he stands before you—undaunted, mighty in heart, noble in mind. I am his mother and much I have feared, but here: hope springs anew. To Hamlet, may his triumphs light Denmark’s path like the northern dawn!
Hamlet (speaking) Madam, you honor me with words more radiant than any crown of laurel or band of gold. If I am brave, it is your love that steels me. To you, mother, who shared my pain—let a grateful son raise his glass.
Laertes (speaking) Let it be known, Gertrude, that in this hall neither grudge nor venom may take root tonight. To peace between us and to Hamlet, whose soul I see shining clear, unclouded by the storms of our making.
Gertrude (thinking) The night is alive, awash with music and ringing cheer. How sweet it is, the sudden ease between Hamlet and Laertes! Two noble sons, their burdens set aside. I long to see Hamlet’s eyes free from haunted worries; I long for laughter to echo where silence has dwelled too long. This cup glimmers—a token of all I wish for him. Let its sweetness mark a new chapter.
Gertrude (speaking) See how the goblet dazzles! I drink to the Prince—for the healing of old wounds, for joy yet to blossom. Hamlet, let this cup seal my faith in you.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, do not—
Gertrude (speaking) No, sweet lord, I will. What price but joy for a mother’s heart! I am proud, and my pride brims over, sparkling brighter than any jewel. If Heaven itself might envy, let it envy this: a son returned, a family mended. To Hamlet! (She drinks)
Hamlet (speaking) Mother—your devotion is a crown beyond any throne. I see in your eyes the promise that winter is past. Let this night be remembered for your courage as much as mine.
Laertes (speaking) Good queen, your words have the power to bind wounds deeper than steel, to lift spirits sunk in sorrow. I toast your bravery and wish you years of peace.
Gertrude (thinking) Such warmth fills me, a lightness I have not known in many moons. Every eye turns with admiration, even those long sour with envy. Hamlet’s smile reaches me, deeper than words, as if there is nothing he cannot overcome. I taste triumph, wrapping it around me like a royal mantle. Yet, within the velvet joy, there is a faint shadow—something stirs, a prickle at the edge of sensation, but I push it aside. Tonight is too precious for doubts.
Gertrude (speaking) Come, Claudius, let us sing Hamlet’s triumph into legend. Let music sound, and may every heart beat as one in celebration.
Claudius (speaking) Yes, my queen, let there be music—let Denmark ring with joy! Our prince and our future, united in hope. All praise to Gertrude, whose faith would make the gods themselves bow in awe.
Hamlet (speaking) If ever I doubted the stars’ guidance, I see their wisdom now. Your blessing, Mother, has turned the world bright. There are no phantoms here, only love returned and multiplied.
Gertrude (thinking) The notes soar through the air, entwining with candlelight, gilding the faces of lords and ladies. The minstrels play, and I feel every eye upon me—a queen, yes, but also a mother restored, my son standing proud before the world. If only this moment could stretch, unbroken, beyond the reach of fate’s cruel touch. 
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, you must know—all my pride, all my hope, every teardrop and every smile—are for you. None shall say that Denmark’s queen shrank from joy, nor from love. You are worthy of every song sung tonight, every cheer raised to the vaulted ceiling.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, your words mend wounds I dared not show. In your regard, I am reborn—a son for whom no night is too long while you stand beside me.
Claudius (speaking) Your bond is a beacon. I, too, rejoice, seeing the rift between hearts healed and glory once more upon the royal house.
Laertes (speaking) If the world must end, let it end thus: with forgiveness, kinship, and the toast of a mother’s hand.
Gertrude (thinking) Even as I bask, warmth swelling, there is a curious sensation—a tingling in my fingers, a heat burning deeper than wine’s familiar glow. Perhaps it is the sheer force of happiness, the press of so many emotions at once. I refuse to tarnish this instant with unease. I am determined to rejoice, to celebrate the impossible made real.
Gertrude (speaking) I feel as though I could rise and dance, carried by pure delight. Drink with me, all—let Hamlet’s name be music on every tongue!
Hamlet (speaking) The court’s laughter is gentler for your joy. I find myself lighter, as though your spirit buoys me.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, dearest, you have always been the soul of this realm. May the Fates smile on your devotion.
Laertes (speaking) Would that every mother loved as fiercely. Tonight, you have more than earned your place in song and tale.
Gertrude (thinking) But there, an odd chill sweeping through, a shiver despite the wine. The hall dips and sways for a heartbeat—nothing, surely, but excitement’s aftermath. A mother’s pride swells within me, defiant against any whisper of discomfort. Hamlet’s victory, our reconciliation, the entire court enveloped in celebration—this, more than any crown, is my legacy.
Gertrude (speaking) Denmark, tonight your queen is filled with such pride as to swell the heart tenfold. No shadows, no doubts—only the memory of this hour, as rich as the wine in my cup. Cherish it, as I do.
Hamlet (speaking) Your joy strengthens me, Mother. Let no misgiving touch us this night.
Claudius (speaking) Well spoken! Joy, Gertrude, is your royal birthright. Bask in it, as you have given us all cause to do.
Laertes (speaking) I will remember you thus, Queen—a laughing, loving spirit at the heart of all celebration.
Gertrude (thinking) The candle flames waver and leap, as if bowing in recognition of my happiness. All the pain, the guilt, the wracking nights in this same hall—gone, replaced by a fierce, proud delight. All that matters is Hamlet and his future, Denmark safe in his hands, and the world remade by my hope for him. Surely nothing can mar this moment.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, I entrust you to the world with all my heart. You will carve your own destiny, with your mother’s blessing carrying you through any darkness.
Hamlet (speaking) That is all I would ask. With you behind me, Mother, I have the courage of ten kings.
Claudius (speaking) Then let the revels continue and history mark this joining of hearts, this triumph over sorrow.
Laertes (speaking) To Hamlet, and to the mother without whom he would be but a shadow—cheers!
Gertrude (thinking) My limbs grow strangely heavy, but I will not falter before the eyes of the court. Let them remember me thus: proud and steadfast, my heart unyielding. Perhaps, if this is fate’s hand upon me, it could choose no better hour than now, no brighter culmination for my life than this celebration of my son.
Gertrude (speaking) So let us feast, and dance, and cherish this night, for joys such as these come but rarely and must be seized with both hands—whatever tomorrow may bring.
Hamlet (speaking) Let us crown this night with laughter and song, and send sorrow fleeing from these halls forever.
Gertrude (thinking) The taste of the wine lingers—bitter now, strange, but I will not recoil. My pride is untarnished, my love undiminished. If this cup was my undoing, then I embrace it, for it sealed my faith in Hamlet before all of Denmark. In this moment, I am both queen and mother, triumphant and unbowed.
Gertrude (speaking) I am content. In my son’s pride and all your happiness, I find peace at last.
Claudius (speaking) All hail, Gertrude—may your name be lauded in tale and history as mother and queen.
Laertes (speaking) May this be the measure of all queens henceforward. To Gertrude, whose heart outshines her crown!
Hamlet (speaking) If anything remains of me after tonight, it will be born of your love, Mother.
Gertrude (thinking) Darkness crowds the edges of my vision, but I meet it gladly, secure in the echo of celebration. Even if silence falls soon, my story will remain—woven into the joy and pride of this night, carried forward in Hamlet’s steps. Let no one forget: Gertrude was proud, she celebrated her son, and for this, she would drink a thousand cups.
Gertrude (speaking) Farewell, my loving people, my precious Hamlet—remember me for this: that I rejoiced in you, and in Denmark, with every breath I drew.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother!
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude!
Laertes (speaking) The queen!—
Gertrude (thinking) Let my pride be my blessing and my final benediction. Let Hamlet’s future blaze with the light of tonight. 
(As the celebration wanes for a heartbeat, and concern rises, Gertrude rests in the memory of her final, proud toast.)"
"stricken, horrified",Gertrude collapses and declares she has been poisoned.,"The great hall resounds with shouts and clashing, and as tension reaches its peak, Gertrude collapses, clutching her throat, and declares she has been poisoned.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Everything blurs—sounds distant, faces smeared by confusion. The cup—I should never have lifted it. The taste—bitter, burning. Something is wrong, horribly wrong. I can't breathe. My limbs no longer answer me. It churns inside, spreading cold, and I begin to fall. Only fragments of their faces flicker above me—my son, his father, his uncle, all mixed with flickering torchlight and shadows that close around. The world shrinks.
Gertrude (speaking)  
No! Stop! The drink—it burns! Oh God, have mercy! The cup... the wine... (coughs) Poison—it was poison! My insides—fire—someone help me!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother! Mother, what do you mean—poison? What cup do you speak of? Answer me! Stay with me! Speak!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Hamlet’s eyes—desperate, terrified. My dear son, I brought you only sorrow. Did I do this to myself? Claudius—where is Claudius? His lips curled when he pressed me to drink, his eyes avoiding mine. Everything I feared—oh, how wrong I have been!
Gertrude (speaking)  
The cup! Oh, Hamlet, do not drink! It is the cup—the King’s cup—it holds death! My throat—it sears; my breath fails me—O, treachery! (coughs violently) Claudius—he did this—oh, wicked deed!
Claudius (speaking)  
Madness has seized her! She raves, my lords. The hour is late, the battle fierce—pay her no mind, she is overwrought.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Overwrought! I saw your face, Claudius! You paled when she drank. Is this your handiwork—your cup, your hands? Answer me!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Their voices, shuddering. No one moves to help me—why do they only stand and stare? My heart throbs as if it will burst. Claudius denies—all lies, his mask slipping. Why did I not see before? My guilt coils. Hamlet, Hamlet, forgive me for all I have done. If I die now—without his forgiveness, I will never rest.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet, forgive—ah!—forgive your wretched mother. I knew not what I did. I saw not the evil lurking here. Betrayed... we are both betrayed.
Laertes (speaking)  
Mother, hold! Do not leave us to this horror. She speaks truly, Hamlet! There is murder here—afoot! My blade, too, was tipped with venom—by the King’s own hand.
Claudius (speaking)  
Traitorous whelp! You dare accuse your King? All is confusion and delusion. Let the court bear witness—the Queen is unwell, beset by her own guilt and nerves.
Horatio (speaking)  
No, my lord—the wine! She named the King’s cup. We saw him press her, when none else would. Speak, someone—fetch help! Do not let her pass!
Gertrude (thinking)  
The pain—insistent, climbing to my head, burning along every vein. My vision tunnels. But their voices give me strength—just a little more, I must speak, I must warn—if Hamlet perishes too, I will not rest. Let them know. Let them see the truth.
Gertrude (speaking)  
False King! Bloody, smiling murderer! My eyes have been veiled until now. Hamlet—my child—heed me: trust not his words or oaths. (gasping) My spirit grows faint... oh God, mercy!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, hold on! Who has done this—admit it, Claudius! You stand revealed! All Denmark will know—the Queen is slain by the King’s own hands!
Claudius (speaking)  
You would dare turn the court against me on a dying woman’s word? Madness—it is madness! Security! Guards—seize Hamlet! Remove these traitors from my sight!
Gertrude (thinking)  
He would silence my son, as he silenced my heart. Everything trembles—the courage to resist comes too late, but I must try once more. My lips numb, my mouth flooded with dread, but nevertheless I raise my voice.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hear me! All who love Denmark, hear! Claudius—he poured the venom! For my sake, let not my death go unmourned, unpunished. Promise me—make him pay! (voice faltering) Hamlet... Hamlet...
Hamlet (speaking)  
I swear, Mother, I will—on your soul and mine! The King shall answer for this blood!
Laertes (speaking)  
The truth rings clear. The King betrays us all—do not let him escape! Hold him!
Claudius (speaking)  
Stop them! Loyal men, to me—your King commands you! Resist this mutiny!
Horatio (speaking)  
All is lost! She fades—hold her, Hamlet. Take her hand.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Hamlet's hand is warm, tender. My breath fails, my body heavy as stone. The noise recedes to a hum, my vision dim. This is the end of fear and guilt. Should I pray? Pray for forgiveness—for light. Let my last sight be Hamlet, not in anger but in love.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet... oh, my son... be gentle... though I failed you. Remember, my love—my love—was always yours. Darkness... comes...
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother! Oh, do not leave me yet—look at me, Mother! Gertrude!
Laertes (speaking)  
She is gone—her eyes have closed. Woe upon us all.
Claudius (speaking)  
Seize them! This is no time for sentiment! The Queen is dead—let order reign!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Order? Is poison your order? Villain, fiend, usurper—I will see you undone!
Horatio (speaking)  
Hold, Hamlet—your grief still fresh, your heart unmoored. The Queen warned us—let her words not dip into silence.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Everything dissolves now—no more pain, only weightless release. I see you, Hamlet, small as the day you first clung to me. If ghosts can weep, I would. I tried—I tried, too late, to save you. The world spins away. If vengeance calms his grief, let it be so. I pray, forgive.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(gasping faintly) Remember me...
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, I remember. For you I shall set all right—though it cost me all peace.
Claudius (speaking)  
Enough of this! Guards! Bind him—a madness is upon the court!
Laertes (speaking)  
No, Claudius! The Queen is slain by your plot; do not expect loyalty. I turn against you—your poison was meant for Hamlet, and for me! Truth—truth will triumph!
Horatio (speaking)  
Let witnesses judge! The Queen declared your crime with her dying breath. Hamlet, the world is watching.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Can they truly hear me? I am lost between the worlds, floating. If vengeance or justice exists, let it unfurl now. Hamlet, I feel your hand, desperate, clinging. I am sorry—so deeply sorry. The poison is cold now, almost gentle. Light fades.
Gertrude (speaking)  
So cold... forgive me... Hamlet...
Hamlet (speaking)  
With all my heart, Mother. Let not your spirit wander in sorrow—a reckoning comes for Claudius!
Claudius (speaking)  
(My lords!—the Queen is not herself—Hamlet threatens the peace, the crown, my life!)
Laertes (speaking)  
No! The hour has come—justice for Gertrude, for all Denmark!
Horatio (speaking)  
Take heart, Hamlet! Her warning rings in every ear—the Queen has fallen, but her truth stands tall.
Gertrude (thinking)  
If I could reach for you, Hamlet, across this shadow, I would shield you from all harm. Hear me, my son, my love is yours forever.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(her voice a mere whisper) My son...
Hamlet (speaking)  
Farewell, Mother. I carry your hope, and your warning.
Claudius (speaking)  
Seize them, I command you! Uphold the King’s law!
Laertes (speaking)  
There is no law in murder! Down with the false King!
Horatio (speaking)  
The Queen’s last breath has shown the truth. The people stir, the guards hesitate—no power can silence a death so cruel.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Noise drifts further now—the heat of life leaves me, the cold urging surrender. I am afraid, yet also at peace. My death is written. Let Hamlet be safe—let the kingdom awake.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(cough barely audible) Heaven... heaven have mercy...
Hamlet (speaking)  
The Queen is dead. Denmark, hear me! Claudius is revealed—a murderer! The cup, the blade, the lies—let none still doubt!
Claudius (speaking)  
Falsehood! Lies!—they will destroy Denmark!
Laertes (speaking)  
By Gertrude’s death, I renounce you, Claudius. Justice must be done!
Horatio (speaking)  
Let all who heard the Queen remember her last words: the King is guilty.
Gertrude (thinking)  
This is the end—the taste of poison lingers, the ache ebbs away. If death has a voice, I hope it is Hamlet's—soft, forgiving. I did love you, my son. Let peace follow when justice is done.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(her last breath, almost silent) Hamlet... forgive...
Hamlet (speaking)  
You are forgiven, Mother—rest now. Justice shall be done.
Claudius (speaking)  
(voice, thin and hollow) All is lost—
Laertes (speaking)  
Come, Hamlet! The time is now.
Horatio (speaking)  
For her—for the Queen—let truth finally triumph.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Darkness closes. I slip beyond. Let Denmark heal, and Hamlet find peace.
(End scene)"
"supportive, loving","Believing Hamlet is winning, Gertrude toasts to Hamlet with the poisoned cup and dies from the poison.","At the royal court, the duel between Hamlet and Laertes is underway, and as Hamlet seems to be triumphing, Gertrude, full of pride and relief, lifts a cup meant for him—unaware it’s laced with deadly poison—and drinks to his success.
Gertrude (thinking) 
The sound of swords clashing echoes fiercely through the hall, each cry and roar braided with dread and hope. My heart thunders in my chest—my dear Hamlet, how valiantly you stands. Every strike makes me ache, yet I cannot turn away. Oh, mercy, let this be the end of his sorrow! Let this be his moment to finally claim peace and pride. My soul trembles with love for my son; please, heavens above, keep him whole.
Claudius (speaking) 
Good Gertrude, do not drink!—it is the cup reserved for Hamlet!
Gertrude (speaking) 
Nonsense, my lord. If ever there was a moment that called for rejoicing, it is now. This is for my son, for the light he brings amidst such shadows. Hamlet, this draught is for thee!
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother, what dost thou do?
Gertrude (speaking) 
I raise this cup, Hamlet, to honor thy courage, thy grace under such cruel trial. I see thee battling, not merely with Laertes, but with every misery we have heaped upon thee. I drink, in the hope that this day will mark not ruin, but redemption for us all.
Laertes (speaking) 
(To Claudius, in a low voice) She knows not what she does. Should we stop her?
Claudius (speaking) 
(aside) It is too late. God have mercy on us.
Gertrude (thinking) 
The wine is rich upon my tongue; it burns my throat sweeter than any vintage I have ever tasted. Is this pride I swallow, or fear? My eyes well as Hamlet glances my way—the shine of hope in his gaze, the faintest curve of a smile just for me, his mother. The world grows brighter. Is that the turn of fortune I sense, or some disquiet rumbling beneath my breast?
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother, has the taste of triumph at last reached your lips? Does it warm your spirit as mine?
Gertrude (speaking) 
Indeed, my son. Every mother lives for such an hour. I know I have faltered—have wronged you in ways a mother never should. But my faith in thee has never wavered, nor my love. Forgive me, Hamlet, for all that has come before—let this cup be a token, let it wash away the stains of our sorrow.
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother, thy grace redeems us both. Stay near me—come what may, let us face fate together.
Gertrude (thinking) 
Oh, the heaviness; a sudden chill creeps up my arms. My fingers tremble, and I must grip tight this goblet lest I drop it. What is this? A spasm through my belly; a tightness in my chest. It cannot be. Surely the nerves of such spectacle play tricks on me. Yet, I can scarce catch my breath.
Laertes (speaking) 
(To Hamlet) Have at thee, now!
Hamlet (speaking) 
On guard, Laertes! My mother's eyes are upon me, her blessing steels my hand.
Claudius (speaking) 
(whispered) Be calm, all will pass as planned...
Gertrude (thinking) 
No—there is something wrong. The room spins, the lights smear in my eyes. Why do the courtiers stare so? My breath falters—the world heaves beneath me. Poison... My mind reels at the word. Did Claudius not warn against it? Was there danger here, lurking in the cup itself? I look at Hamlet—so alive, his spirit undimmed. Oh, God, let him not drink after me!
Gertrude (speaking) 
Hamlet...I—I must speak... My boy, do not...do not drink from this cup...
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother? What ails you? You pale and reel as if struck.
Gertrude (speaking) 
Listen, my child—sweet prince, the drink... the drink is... I—I did not know... It burns—a fire, not joy, but ruin. My son, beware! There is death in the wine.
Claudius (speaking) 
She grows faint. Attend upon the Queen!
Laertes (speaking) 
(to himself) The plot unravels—guilt claws at my heart.
Gertrude (thinking) 
Each heartbeat shrieks now, an anguished drumbeat to the truth. I see Claudius—his fear cracks through his mask. I have been the pawn of others’ ambition. My Hamlet, my precious child—how I would give anything to bear your pain instead, to shield you from this coil of malice.
Gertrude (speaking) 
Forgive me! Oh, forgive me! If my love for thee could turn poison to balm, thou wouldst never know pain again. I am so sorry, Hamlet. For all—the haste, the blindness, the trust so wrongly given... Oh, let this be enough. Let my death, my warning, save thee.
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother, stay with me! Oh, heavens, what treachery works here?
Gertrude (speaking) 
No more, Hamlet. Think not of vengeance—think of love—remember me gentle, if only for this, that even in my last, my spirit rose to shield thee.
Gertrude (thinking) 
It grows so cold. My limbs numb; the crowd’s voices flutter and fade, like birds at dusk. Hamlet’s face, his anguish twisting in the gloom, is all I see. My only son—the little boy I cradled, now a man lost among blades and lies. If I am to go, let it be with all the love I could not say coursing through my blood to the last.
Gertrude (speaking) 
Hamlet... son... I loved thee—always...
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother!
Claudius (speaking) 
Remove her hence! Bring physicians!
Laertes (speaking) 
(to Hamlet) The Queen, your mother, is dead. I am sorry, most truly sorry. The foul practice hath come to naught but ruin on us all.
Gertrude (thinking) 
No pain now—only a gentle rush. My mind floats back, through years bright and broken, to laughter, to his small hand in mine. Would that I could hold him as before, that he would know none of this hate. My end is near; I hope only that my last act saved him, that in this poisoned chalice, I have offered him life. My soul drifts—gentle, untethered at last—toward some quiet shore.
Gertrude (speaking) 
Farewell... remember me for love...
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother—gone. The venom that took her life I will turn against all our wrongs!
Claudius (speaking) 
(panicked) Hamlet, listen—I meant no harm!
Laertes (speaking) 
Noble Hamlet, the King’s to blame. The weapon and the drink—both laid by his command. I confess, I am complicit, but my soul is wracked with remorse. Your mother’s death lies at his feet.
Gertrude (thinking) 
One last glimmer—the vengeance that pulses through Hamlet, the reckoning at hand. Shall blood answer blood, or can a mother’s love soften even this? The world fades to a hush, but I feel Hamlet’s fury, balanced always against his grief and wavering hope. Let him choose wisely; let love guide what sword and poison cannot.
Hamlet (speaking) 
All is revealed. O, villainy, thou art unveiled at last! But at what price—my mother’s heart, my happiness? The day is darkened, heavy with the cost of truth.
Gertrude (speaking) 
(her voice only a whisper in the air) Let love endure, even when breath is gone...
Hamlet (speaking) 
Mother, I will not forget thee, nor the lesson writ so dearly here: trust not in poisoned cups, nor poisoned souls, but let remembrance cleave onto love, in spite of the pain.
Gertrude (thinking) 
If I am but a memory, let it be a bright one in Hamlet’s heart—eclipsing all the sorrow that has brought us to this hour. The cold holds me gently, and as my sight narrows, his figure, blurring, yet blazing with cherished light, is the last gift, the final comfort. Love, persisting.
Gertrude (speaking) 
(her final breath barely formed words) Hamlet... my... son...
(She slips from her chair, the cup clattering, her presence lingering for a moment in the silence that follows.)
Hamlet (speaking) 
She is gone. My heart—my heart is cleft in twain.
Horatio (speaking) 
Hamlet, let me mourn with thee. Her love was true, whatever shadows haunted this court.
Gertrude (thinking) 
What would I say, if words could find me yet? Take care, Hamlet—let not poison claim thee as it has me. Let love, forewarned, be the salve for wounds unseen. Farewell, my dear son... forever.
(As the stage grows still but for quiet weeping, the poisoned chalice stands alone—a tragic emblem of ambition and unexpected sacrifice, yet still, within every glass, the echo of a mother’s unwavering love.)"
"unaware, loving",Gertrude drinks a toast to Hamlet from the poisoned cup meant for him.,"The halls are tense with anticipation as the fencing match begins; amidst the court’s uneasy celebration, Gertrude, unknowing of Claudius’s fatal plot, lifts the poisoned chalice in a loving toast to her son Hamlet, meant to honor his courage.
Gertrude (thinking) The air is thick with expectation. My dear son faces Laertes, and although the blossoms of youth dance in their eyes, the weight of grief clings to our family, and I, mother and queen, must smile through it all. Hamlet—my heart aches for all you have endured, and tonight, before all, I will show you the love and pride a mother bears.
Claudius (speaking) Give them the foils, young Osric. Hamlet, Laertes, choose your weapons! And let all hearts be light: this is but friendly sport, no more.
Osric (speaking) Here are the foils, my noble lords. Which will you handle first?
Hamlet (speaking) I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance, your skill will shine more brightly.
Laertes (speaking) You mock me, Hamlet, but I accept. Our swords, though, are equal.
Gertrude (thinking) Their courtly banter masks wounds I cannot see. Surely, this spirited match will bring some release, some momentary peace or joy to my son’s haunted mind.
Horatio (speaking) Your grace, all’s ready.
Claudius (speaking) Let the bout begin. And Gertrude, sweet queen, do honour us with your watchful eyes.
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, my son, both, I watch with love deeper than the sea. Hamlet—be swift, but not reckless. Laertes—may skill and gentleness guide you.
Hamlet (speaking) Have no fear, Mother. I am stripped of all but wit and will.
Laertes (speaking) Then on, Hamlet.
(They fence. The room thrums with intensity. Gertrude anxiously observes every movement.)
Gertrude (thinking) Each clash, each breath—they are sons of Denmark but shadows of the past flicker through their every glance. Claudius seems unsettled, his eyes darting between goblet, blade, and me. Why this tension, my husband? Is it stakes or pride that tightens your brow?
Claudius (speaking) Give Hamlet the first hit. Excellent, our son.
Osric (speaking) A palpable hit, indeed!
Laertes (speaking) Still, we play on.
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet glances at me now—he seeks comfort. I must give it. In this little world of ours, love must speak louder than suspicion.
Gertrude (speaking) Well struck, Hamlet! You have your mother’s blessing. All of Denmark rejoices to see you shine.
Hamlet (speaking) To please you is victory enough for any man.
Claudius (speaking) Come, a toast for the victor. [He lifts the cup, his voice steady but with the faintest tremor.] Hamlet—this pearl is thine. Drink from this cup when weary.
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet’s brow knots, suspicion shadowing his features. Why so wary, my boy? This is celebration, not peril. And yet... Claudius insists so keenly. What urgent air is this?
Hamlet (speaking) Not yet, my lord. The match calls me still.
Laertes (speaking) Another round, Hamlet?
Hamlet (speaking) Gladly.
(They fence again; swords clatter, feet scuff, breaths quicken.)
Gertrude (thinking) I cannot bear the strain in Hamlet’s eyes. The court is gathered as for feast, but there is little laughter now. Hamlet stumbles, and my heart leaps in my throat. Is it simply the strain? Or something beneath?
Claudius (speaking) Pause awhile, let them breathe. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, wipe thy brow.
Hamlet (speaking) Thank you, my lord, but let me finish first.
Gertrude (speaking) My dear, your strength lies not just in arm or wit, but in your heart, which has weathered every storm. Come, all—let us toast to peace and reconciliation, the hope every mother craves.
Claudius (speaking) [hurried] Do not drink, Gertrude!
Gertrude (thinking) His voice cuts. Why so sharp, Claudius? That cup—he tries to shield it, but why? I have seen too many secrets hidden by polite words. And yet, he urges Hamlet to drink. Why withhold it from me? Have I not suffered enough to deserve at least a taste of happiness?
Gertrude (speaking) I pray you, pardon me. I will drink.
(Her hand is steady as she raises the goblet.)
Gertrude (thinking) My lips touch the rim: sweet, bitter. Is this not fitting? To toast my son, to celebrate his valor, to drown my worries if but for a moment. Hamlet, let this gesture show you my love, pure and unclouded.
Gertrude (speaking) The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet!
Hamlet (speaking) Good madam—
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, do not—
Gertrude (speaking) Nay, I drink.
(She drinks deeply and sets the goblet aside.)
Gertrude (thinking) Warmth seeps down, a shiver not unwelcome. Cheers erupt, but tension slices through the crowd. Claudius pales. What have I missed in this deadly play?
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, are you well?
Gertrude (speaking) Ha! I am well, my prince. Never prouder of you than now.
Laertes (speaking) On with the bout, Hamlet?
Hamlet (speaking) On, then.
(They fence again. Gertrude watches, the world blurring at its edges. She tries to cling to the moment, to the faces, even as sensation slips.)
Gertrude (thinking) My head swims. Odd. The room unspools, sound slows. Claudius’s voice behind the cheering—it booms and then recedes. My hands… are cold. Is it nerves? Or—did I drink too much too fast?
Claudius (speaking) [beside himself] She swoons to see them bleed.
Osric (speaking) No, my lord, the queen has swooned.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother?
Gertrude (speaking) I—I am faint. A sudden chill—no, a burning. My Hamlet… forgive me, I do not wish to alarm.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, sit—fetch water, someone! Is she ill?
Gertrude (thinking) My tongue grows heavy. Vision splinters—Hamlet’s face, desperate, edges blurring. Claudius whispers fiercely to an attendant, but he does not meet my gaze. Something is wrong. I—did I trust too easily? Was there malice in kindness, poison in the cup?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet… the drink—the drink! I am poisoned.
Hamlet (speaking) Poisoned? Who? Mother—speak!
Gertrude (speaking) The cup… oh, Hamlet, I knew not. My heart, forgive me—I wished only to show my love, nothing more.
Gertrude (thinking) Oh, God, to die so—unknowing, in celebration, the cruelest jest. My son, my boy is frightened. I cannot bear it. My limbs are heavy, heat lashes through me. What have I done? Or rather—what has been done to me?
Hamlet (speaking) Who has done this? Claudius—speak!
Laertes (speaking) [gasping, pale] The king, the king’s to blame… the poison was meant for you, Hamlet. I—I am sorry.
Claudius (speaking) [horrified, desperate] She is mistaken! You are all deceived—
Gertrude (speaking) No more, Claudius. My eyes clear now, though only at the end. Hamlet, your mother loves you—never doubt that. Let my end show the depth of my care, though I go blind to the poison beneath our roof.
Gertrude (thinking) The court is in uproar. I feel myself loosening, tethered by love and regret. I am not afraid—only grieved, for what has passed between us, mother and son. Hamlet’s tears collect in the deep well of my vision. If only I had guarded thee harder, trusted less, loved better.
Gertrude (speaking) Farewell, sweet prince. Find the peace I could not give you. Remember me as I was—not in this agony, but in gentle embrace, in hope.
Gertrude (thinking) My soul ebbs to the music of his voice—aching, pleading, lost. My body aches, but more so, my heart, for the secrets and sorrow that haunted our house. My Hamlet—let my death be your warning and your shield. The warmth fades now. Darkness, soft, envelops me. I release the world, clutching only one truth: that I loved my son, blindly, but utterly.
(And with that, Gertrude slips from her chair, her breaths shallow, arm outstretched toward her son as the court erupts in chaos.)
Horatio (speaking) O, the queen! She dies, she dies!
Claudius (speaking) [voice cracking, scrambling] The blame is not mine—
Hamlet (speaking) Treachery! Seek it out! Lock the doors!
Gertrude (thinking) If there is memory after, let it be of this: that love, unknowing, bore me to my end, still searching my son’s eyes for forgiveness and peace.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet… forgive… me… 
(Silence falls, Gertrude's gaze locked on Hamlet, her face a mask of sorrow and devotion, as life ebbs away.)"
agonized,Gertrude collapses and declares she has been poisoned.,"In the grand hall, during a royal banquet, Gertrude collapses and declares she has been poisoned.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The air thickens—my fingers tremble, vision swaying—I know something is terribly wrong. Everything tastes of metal, bitterness, finality; fear reaches up, clawing into my throat. My chest constricts—each heartbeat strikes louder, more urgent. The goblet—Claudius’s hands—the room spins, anguish surges inside me. This pain is not natural. No, it tears at my soul. I am dying. I must tell them—I must warn Hamlet…the truth must not die with me.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Oh—oh God!—the room turns before my eyes. My limbs—they will not obey me—Claudius, Hamlet—listen! Each breath claws at my ribs deeper than the last. The wine I drank—no, no. The wine—oh, this is no ordinary faintness! I am… poisoned! Poison! Ah! My soul screams in agony! Someone—help me! Help your Queen!
Claudius (speaking)  
Gertrude—my dear heart! What madness is this? You swoon, my love! Shall I call for leeches, for balm, for your physicians?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You—husband—do not touch me! Let none come near! My skin—burns—my blood is frost and fire together. My words—they must out, no matter the pain. Hamlet, look to me, do not avert your eyes! The cup—the cup! I drank—I drank from it. Death is inside me—it writhes within me like a serpent. Who… who could do this? My child, my boy—do you hear your mother’s cry?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother! O, God! Poisoned? Speak—speak plainly! Who did this? Who gave you that cup? Stand back, all damnéd villains, or I’ll strike you down!
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet…my son…my heart aches, but worse is this burning, this ache beneath my breast. It is too late—I see death’s shadow lengthening above me. The cup, child—the cup you saw me raise—but a moment gone. Shield your lips from it. I beg you—this was meant for you, not me. I see it now—such cunning—such monstrous cruelty. Claudius…King…what face would poison wear but yours, who lusted for the throne so easily? Oh, heaven! My body rebels—my soul aches with shame and terror.
Claudius (speaking)  
Madness takes you, Gertrude! You accuse me so, before the court, before your son? Why would I wish you harm—my queen, my treasure? Guards, seize her, restrain her! She is overcome by fever, by delusions!
Gertrude (speaking)  
Dare you speak in riddles, traitor? My tongue is heavy—my lips struggle—but mark me, child, for my voice is true as spring water. Your uncle—he—he fears your soul, your claim, your birthright. The poison was not for me, but for thee, Hamlet. O, bitter fate that I become the vessel of your undoing. My insides burn—a thousand fires—oh, let me not die with this sin unspoken! All—hear me! The King—he means to murder Hamlet! The poison ran through me, not by fate, but by design—his design.
Laertes (speaking)  
Poison! She speaks of poison—of treachery! Claudius, what plot have you spun? My own quarrel turns to ice in my veins—I see your lies laid bare.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother! Do not go! Stay awake—breathe! If you sleep, let it not be forever! Claudius—villain, monster—unsheath your evil deeds. Look what you have wrought! My mother’s agony unfolds because of your greed, your foul designs!
Gertrude (thinking)  
The ache grows—the world recedes in pale, flickering veils. My lips numb, but my mind spits against the darkening tide. Hamlet’s face—shocked, helpless—like when he was a babe, seeking comfort at my breast. He must know it all, he must be free of lies. If only I had shielded him sooner—if only I had seen Claudius’s true face. My flesh is failing. My mission—my warning—must not drown with me.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet…forgive me—I was blind, tangled by love, by duty, by fears for you. Claudius poured rank poison into my ear, as he once did to your father’s sleeping body. Know this: your father’s death was murder—murder by this false king’s hands. I drank the cup unmeant for me—your blood was the price. My eyes open too late—I have failed you, failed Denmark. I go, but let my truth be the flame to light your vengeance. My son, my light—do not trust Claudius. Let all the world witness—hear—in these last cruel moments: I, Gertrude, wife once to Hamlet of Denmark, declare my murderer—your king, your uncle!
Claudius (speaking)  
Enough! Guards! Seize the prince! These ravings must be silenced—my realm cannot bear such spectacle. She dies—the fever speaks, not her mind!
Hamlet (speaking)  
No more, Claudius! The truth fouls your tongue like the cup fouled my mother’s veins! I will not be caught by your guards, nor will these lies shelter you. Guards, stand back! Let none bar my blade from the villain who poisoned the Queen!
Horatio (speaking)  
O sweet Queen, our hearts break! Hamlet—by heaven, she tells true! The King’s face blanches with guilt. We must act—now, swift as vengeance itself!
Gertrude (thinking)  
My vision dims—how cold the torches glow, how distant the clamor of voices, their faces blurring, blending. Have I said enough? Has my voice carried the weight of truth? Let Denmark not mourn its Queen, but arm itself with her warning. Give Hamlet strength—let old lies crumble beneath my dying breath.
Gertrude (speaking)  
My hands—so cold, like the sea in deepest winter. Hamlet—come here, child. Let me see you, truly see you. Take my hand—feel the lifeblood falter. Remember your mother, not as a queen, nor as a pawn, but as the woman who bore you and, in the end, spoke her soul. My guilt is heavy. My love for you heavier still. Use my death well—unravel these knots. Set Denmark free. I—oh—darkness falls—farewell.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother! No, no! Stay with me! Do not yield to this chill—do not let the poison’s work erase your memory from the world! To you, murderer—Claudius—I swear vengeance. Hear her voice, Denmark! Know your true betrayer!
Claudius (speaking)  
Hamlet, you overreach—madness and poison turn your mind from reason. Guards, take him! I am your King—my word is law!
Laertes (speaking)  
Not so fast, Claudius! I see with unclouded eyes—she exposed your crimes, as she exposed my own complicity. I, too, drank from your poisoned schemes! No more—I shall not be your tool.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother’s blood shouts within me—my sword is justice! Stand back, or join the damned—let none who wields villainy escape reckoning!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Voices fade—my body surrenders to stillness. I drift, at last unburdened. Hamlet’s promise echoes as the world softens—my warning passes to him, to the watchers, to those who still breathe. If there is justice, let it rise through the son who heard his mother’s dying words. Yield to rest, Gertrude—your secrets have been set free.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(softly, with fading breath)  
Remember—remember me, not as I die, but as I tried to speak at last. Let love and truth outlive the foulest cunning. Hamlet—my son—avenge, forgive, survive… (Her voice trails off into silence.)
Horatio (speaking)  
She is gone! The Queen’s spirit flees—her words hang heavy in this hall! Bear witness, all—murder stalked her end. Hamlet, I stand by you. Denmark must be cleansed.
Hamlet (speaking)  
O, I am lost—but anger steels my veins. My mother’s death is not in vain. Claudius, see what you have wrought! Your hour of justice is upon you.
Claudius (speaking)  
Traitors ring me round, spurred by a dying woman’s poison-born delusion! Recall your loyalty to your King! Guards! Seize them all, silence these crowing accusers!
Laertes (speaking)  
No, Claudius! Your power falters—no sword or crown can hide your guilt. I was your pawn, but no longer! I denounce you, before the court, before the gods!
Hamlet (speaking)  
The Queen’s last breath, her agony unleashed your undoing! Mark it well—my blade is sworn to answer for her suffering!
(Shouting, clamor, the crash of metal—loyalty and betrayal grapple in the throne room. Meanwhile, Gertrude’s still form lies shrouded in sorrow, her warning echoing in every heart.)
Gertrude (thinking)  
I am gone from them, floating far from pain, from king and son, from marble floor and poisoned cups. But in their world, my agony unfurls into battle, into truth. Let my son find peace, or vengeance—a better fate than I snatched at blindly in life. I have done all I can do.
(The hall dissolves into uproar—from Gertrude’s agonized death, from unveiled villainy, future events spiral unsparingly. The word ‘Poisoned’ whispers like a curse, forever stamped upon this trembling court.)"
"loving, oblivious","Gertrude drinks from the poisoned cup to toast Hamlet, believing he is winning the match.","The grand hall is hushed in anticipation as Gertrude, radiating pride and tenderness, lifts a jeweled cup to toast her son Hamlet, who appears to be besting Laertes in the duel.
Gertrude (thinking) The tension is palpable; every gaze is fixed upon the two young men clashing steel for steel. My Hamlet, flushed with victory—how noble he looks, how resolute. Each breath he takes emboldens my spirit, and yet my heart hammers with an unnameable worry, for I have seen too many shadows of late cross his path. But love and joy push aside my unease—he wins! He returns to the light! Oh, how Polonius's death, Ophelia's madness, have weighed heavy upon us all, but this moment, this contest, feels like the undoing of so many sorrows. The cup in my hand sparkles; the wine within promises only celebration.
Gertrude (speaking) Sweet lords, allow me a moment! This cup I lift, a mother's pledge to Fortune's darling! To Hamlet—and to the days when we shall have reason only to rejoice!
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, do not drink—
Gertrude (speaking) My dear lord, how can I not? See how he stands, my son, the hope of Denmark! It ill becomes us not to toast him now. My voice shall rise above the martial din, a prayer that crowns his brow with laurel and love.
Hamlet (speaking) Good mother, reserve your cheers for when this match is won in full. I have much to prove still—Laertes presses hard and I would not have your joy be troubled by a sudden turn.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, my words are not so fickle as fortune's tide. My heart aches for all you have suffered—your father's passing, the chill that has come between us; let this moment mend all wounds, so that mother and son become as one again, in happiness and hope. Let not the sword or fate come between us. And so—I drink! (she raises the cup and drinks) May this be the drink of peace restored, and grief undone!
Claudius (speaking) Stay your hand, I pray you—
Gertrude (thinking) His anxiety strikes me strange. Why should the king, my dearest husband, quail at my cheer? This wine—rich, fragrant, as any I have tasted—slides warm down my throat, and still I do not comprehend his fear. Is there something in these games, some secret woven in the gleaming blades or in the borrowed smiles around us?
Laertes (speaking) My lady, may your toast be as golden as your wishes.
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, Laertes. I see your father in your eyes, your noble carriage as you spar with Hamlet. It wounds me to think how sorrow has made adversaries of you two young men who once shared laughter in these halls. Let us drink to a peace beyond this contest—a peace that belies all past offence.
Hamlet (speaking) We shall have such peace, mother, if only shadows do not linger to cloud it. Laertes, you have my respect, through blood and strife.
Laertes (speaking) And you mine, Hamlet. Our hands, perhaps, remember loss more keenly than friendship, but may the arms that clasp our mothers' hearts one day reunite us in truth.
Gertrude (thinking) The words resonate within me; Laertes is but another child undone by grief, as Hamlet is, as I am myself, watered by endless tears. Yet tonight, only the music of hope can fill me. This wine is gentle, and the growing warmth in my chest—surely that is love, not unease? Why does Claudius still regard me so with those shadowed eyes?
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, the cup you drank—there was another meant for Hamlet. I—I would not see you come to harm.
Gertrude (speaking) Meant for Hamlet? My lord, your words wander in riddles. You set this table, you called for merriment—would you see any here come to harm? This is a night for joy. Your concern is mislaid. The Queen of Denmark needs no nurse amid festival. Would you have Hamlet parched and mother unsmiling?
Horatio (speaking) Your Majesty, forgive me, but perhaps the games are pressing too long. Hamlet is weary. Shall he pause, refresh himself?
Gertrude (speaking) Let no one caution my son but I—see how he moves! Swift as thought, his sword sings. This cup I claimed, it is mine, not for Hamlet. If it offends, let me bear the brunt, for a mother's blessing is stronger than any misfortune.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, your spirit is boundless, yet I would not see you overtaxed in celebration.
Gertrude (speaking) Oh Hamlet, if only joy could shield all danger, if a mother's love were armor. Perhaps in my toast—my little prayer—I have sealed more than a merriment, but a promise, a bond between us that all the world may envy.
(There is a low rumble of concern as Gertrude sways slightly.)
Gertrude (thinking) The hall feels suddenly strange, as though all the lights have dimmed and the laughter of courtiers echoes from a distant shore. My cheeks are flushed, yet a coldness seeps beneath my skin. Was the wine too strong? Or does this strange heaviness root in some unspoken grief?
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude! Are you unwell? Sit—call for a cushion, fetch cool water—someone attend the queen!
Gertrude (speaking) Dear husband, worry not. It is only the excitement—too much cheer in too brief a span! I am well. Hamlet deserves all the joy we can summon for him tonight.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! You are pale—has the contest wearied you?
Gertrude (speaking) (with a trembling laugh) Wearied? No—'tis but the weight of happiness and longing fulfilled. Hamlet, come nearer, let me look upon you. When you were a babe you would take my hand and all the world righted itself. Now, in this crowded chamber, I take your victory as my own.
Gertrude (thinking) Now the cords of my chest are drawn tight—a curious joy, veined with pain. My hands tingle, the cup slipping from my grasp. The assembled faces blur, as if seen through a veil spun of memory and yearning. Am I dreaming, or is some other hand guiding fate tonight?
Laertes (speaking) The queen falters—let her rest.
Claudius (speaking) Summon the physicians, now!
Gertrude (speaking) No need, please. I am only overcome by the hope that tomorrow will bring. My Hamlet, your triumph is Denmark’s solace. Let no shadow rest upon this hour.
Gertrude (thinking) I have loved both these men before me—my late king, and Claudius who sought to knit up my broken heart. And Hamlet, my very soul walking the world. Did I raise him only for endless strife? My vision slips at the edges, my body's meat grown unfaithful, as if it too yearns for release. The cup. Was there something in the taste? A sharpness just beneath the sweetness. Or do I imagine poisons where there are only regrets?
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, look at me—what ails you? Speak plain, I entreat you!
Gertrude (speaking) I see you, Hamlet, as clear as day across a summer field. All the ache of the past years slides away when I look at you thus. Forgive me if my form betrays me—my heart is firmer than my flesh, it seems.
Gertrude (thinking) I am dizzy now, the hall spinning like a child's toy, voices layered atop voices. Claudius, so pale and rigid, as if he knew more than he dared confess. Should I fear? I drank in joy, not malice. I celebrated my son, as any mother—my only wish was for harmony restored, wounds bound, ghosts laid to rest.
Claudius (speaking) She is ill—this is not as it should be!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! By heaven, the queen swoons!*
Gertrude (speaking) It is only a passing faint, Hamlet. Do not fret. My mind swims with such fondness for you. I have missed you, my son—missed your laughter, your softer words. May you be safe, wherever breezes carry you.
Gertrude (thinking) The pain comes sharper now, a flowering cold blooming in my limbs, stiffening my jaw. I see, at last, the flicker of horror in Claudius's eyes—a dawning, dreadful understanding. He fears for something more than my health. Did he know? Was this planned for another’s lips? My Hamlet, this cannot be—the world cannot be so cruel.
Gertrude (speaking) (voice faltering) I…I pray you all, be kind to my Hamlet. He has suffered enough. Let not this day be blackened by further grief.
Hamlet (speaking) What is this? speak you plain, mother!
Gertrude (speaking) (her words slurring, weak) The drink…I meant only…to bless you, Hamlet. My dear, you must beware the wine—the cup… Do not drink, my son. Do not…
Gertrude (thinking) My eyes gather shadows at the edges. I reach for Hamlet, my hand trembling, but he is already receding, a sail vanishing on a storm-tossed sea. The world narrows to his face, stricken, his lips shaping my name. I am sorry, so sorry—had I known, I would have guarded you with my very life. And perhaps, in this, I have.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! O heavens, what fell plot is this? Stay with me, mother, oh stay!
Gertrude (speaking) My son… Remember me… Forgive…
Gertrude (thinking) And so, love outpaces poison, and I slip from this hall, unwilling, but heartsick with hope that, somehow, he is saved. The pain ebbs, replaced with a kind of peace—the long ache of sorrow washed away. Hamlet, my darling boy, let the world be gentle at last.
(Her head bows, the cup glimmers at her feet. The hall is silent save for Hamlet's anguished cry, and Claudius’s guilty gasp. In the moment before darkness claims her, Gertrude’s last thought is of the sunlit days of Hamlet’s childhood, laughter ringing off castle stones—before intrigue, before poison, only love, fierce and shining.)"
"dying, shocked",Gertrude dies after drinking the poisoned cup.,"The grand hall is alive with revelry and tension as Gertrude, Queen of Denmark, lifts the jeweled cup to her lips and drinks, unwittingly sealing her fate with Claudius’s poison.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The sweet wine burns more than I recall. Such revels, such joy and yet—what chill rises up my throat? My fingertips prick as though needles dance upon my skin. I cannot—why do the faces blur around me?
Gertrude (speaking)  
My lord—Claudius—this drink, it scorches me. My heart is as if clamped in winter’s fist. What’s this? The lights flicker, the air is heavier than any velvet drape… What have I done?
Claudius (speaking)  
Madam, you are pale. Perhaps too much excitement, dearest queen? Sit, the match is nearly ended—let us not fret over trifles.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother? You spill the cup. What troubles you? You grasp for air—your lips are white as fevered linen. Speak—what ghosts have come over you?
Gertrude (thinking)  
My son’s voice echoes in my mind, jagged and echoing from a distant shore. The veins in my hands stand up, dark and thready. Is this death’s summons? No, not yet—not so soon. My mouth is sour, thick. Poison? No… impossible.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet—my breath’s grown short. My body rebels, wracked against my will. Oh—God—was the wine so bitter, or was it honey masked with venom? Who… who has done this?
Claudius (speaking)  
Compose yourself, my queen! Call the physician—she is overcome with feeling, that is all.
Laertes (speaking)  
The queen! She swoons—this is no simple faint. Ah, heavens, what have we wrought?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, answer me! Did you taste of the cup? From whence came your agony?
Gertrude (thinking)  
The icy pulse slides beneath my skin—my feet are wooden blocks. My hair presses to my brow, damp, heavy as stone. Claudius steals sideways glances, fidgeting—why the sweat on his cheek? What does he hide? The cup—my hand trembles recalling its upward arc and the trust, the sweet trust, that saw me sipping.
Gertrude (speaking)  
The drink, Hamlet—the cup, the cup. I was careless—thirsty—and now the world narrows to a single tune, a death knell ringing behind my eyes. It… it was not meant for me, was it? Tell me, someone—what treachery has passed my lips?
Claudius (speaking)  
Sweet Gertrude, do not torment yourself. Call for water—pour it, let her cool.
Osric (speaking)  
To arms! Fetch a leech, bring help! The queen reels as though stricken.
Laertes (speaking)  
The cup was poisoned. O God, now every deed is counted. Queen, forgive me. My hand is red and cannot be cleansed.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Poison? My marrow contracts, shriveling. The room’s grand tapestries twist about like serpents; I see only Hamlet, dear child, rage and sorrow crystallized in his face. My death purls toward me, an unstoppable tide. But—no. I will not go quietly; they will know my warning.
Gertrude (speaking)  
I… I drank unconsciously—there was no malice, no thought. Yet now each inhale is cruelty, and my tongue is as heavy as iron. Hamlet! Oh, Hamlet, beware—something most foul circulates at this court. My spirit cleaves to yours, my son. Trust no one—no one!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Oh, heart! Give me the cup—who did this to you? Mother, speak! Who set this snare?
Gertrude (speaking)  
The king—your uncle—my husband—he gave the wine with a trembling hand, averted eyes. I did not see it, I did not want to see… The shadows deepen, Hamlet. My sight flickers—but listen, even as my body deserts me. I beg you—shine your gaze not on me, but on the blackness that clings to this throne.
Claudius (speaking)  
She raves, she is not herself—her senses falter.
Laertes (speaking)  
Never! She speaks the flame of truth—my tongue is loosed by death’s pressure. King’s hand poured the poison. Forgive, Queen—your fall was not aimed for, but it is my wound to bear in hell.
Gertrude (thinking)  
A fullness in my skull, as if my mind swells to burst. My bones, my poor bones, ache with cold. This cannot be undone. Death stands in the wings, his hand outstretched. I mourn for Hamlet—I wish only to cradle his cheek, to say “forgive”—too late, all laced with regret. This ending—is it my penance for years of blindness? For the warmth folded in murderous arms?
Gertrude (speaking)  
My hands—Hamlet, feel them, see how cold they cling? My lips numbed, cannot form the thousand apologies my soul howls for. I am—I am mother, wife, and queen, laid low by hidden rot. My boy, let daylight chase ruin from your veins—fight for the sliver of goodness that yet remains amidst venom and betrayal. Do not let bitterness claim you whole. Let my suffering anchor you, lest you drown in vengeance.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother—dear soul, stay! Fogs may part—a word, a look more—
Gertrude (thinking)  
My vision contracts, a tunnel of shadow with Hamlet at its vanishing point. Is this what the stories promised? Warmth fleeing, memory folding into itself? I would hold him, press his grief into my breast, draw all pain away—but my body is lead, my will a tattered banner. Regret drowns reason. I cannot breathe.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Forgive me—my son—my sweet prince. I knew not, I saw not—oh!—if there is light beyond, I will watch for you. Stand tall, Hamlet; make meaning from this wreck. My love… I—cannot—
Claudius (speaking)  
Guards! Support her—she faints, she’s seized with suffering!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Stand not between us! Traitor, murderer—each drop she drank will thunder on your head! Oh heaven, your records are rich with my despair.
Gertrude (thinking)  
I wish for spring, for laughter, for innocence returned. Only guilt pours through me now, seeping beneath the silk and gold. My last thoughts: Hamlet’s laughter, small and wild; sunlight on Ophelia’s yellow hair; the shiver, then bloom, of love before ambition infected our house. My God—my God—let this cup pass from him, if from me not.
Gertrude (speaking)  
I am undone. Poison in my veins, truth in my last gasp. Let Denmark see: the queen is fallen, but her heart speaks plain at the end. Hamlet—remember me not with fury, but with pity. All is darkness. I give you my blessing, if it means a sliver of peace may yet pierce this night.
Laertes (speaking)  
O Queen, forgive—my own guilt is a river; your mercy could not stem it long.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother… She is gone. She is gone, and the world is made less.
Gertrude (thinking)  
A child’s hands in mine, warm, trusting; the memory of a lullaby echoing as the dark tide closes over me. If there is peace, let it come quickly. Let all sorrows cease.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Take heed… let poison end with me… Let light—be restored—
Claudius (speaking)  
Remove her. The ceremony must—must go on! All’s yet to be done!
Horatio (speaking)  
My lord, this death is monstrous. Such evil—how can men rejoice in these walls?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Every stone will weep for her, Horatio. Should vengeance not answer, let time itself curse the guilty.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The pain has lessened. Warmth beckons me elsewhere. I hear distant bells. Hamlet, do not waste your soul on darkness. If I am to die, let my death be a warning, not a chain. I drift…
Gertrude (speaking)  
The cup—remember—the cup… guard yourself, my son…
Gertrude (thinking)  
It is over. The world unspools. My breath dissolves. I am—nothing, and yet—somewhere, perhaps, I forgive.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Farewell… my son…
(Gertrude’s body slips from the chair, the poisoned cup rolling to the floor, reflecting the flicker of torchlight as the hall erupts into cries and chaos.)
Hamlet (speaking)  
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet queen; and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
(And in that hush, the palace, once filled with music and laughter, is drenched in silence, newly haunted by the absence of Denmark’s queen.)"
affectionate,"Gertrude drinks a toast to her son Hamlet from the poisoned cup, unaware it is poisoned.","In the grand hall of Elsinore, the court gathers for the duel between Hamlet and Laertes; Gertrude, brimming with affection and pride for her son, lifts the golden goblet meant for the victor, unaware that Claudius has poisoned the cup.
Gertrude (thinking) The court breathes with sharp anticipation, yet I feel only the thrum of my heart, prideful and anxious for Hamlet's sake. His face—so like his father’s—bears the wounds of all these months, but tonight, perhaps, there will be triumph. The cup catches the light; I see my reflection ripple, blurred by wine and possibility.
Claudius (speaking) Prepare to offer the cup, my queen! The match begins—a test of skill and fortune, for Denmark’s honor and our son’s heart.
Hamlet (speaking) I am ready, my lord. The foils are balanced, the eyes of all await the contest. Yet, mother, your smile steadies me—would I could always fight thus, with your gaze upon me.
Gertrude (speaking) My dear Hamlet, you make your mother’s heart soar. Whatever comes, you are Denmark’s brightest hope. If warmth and well-wishing could shield you, you would stand invincible.
Laertes (speaking) I am honored, prince. I pray our contest is fair and true. For the sake of both our fathers, let it be noble.
Hamlet (speaking) Agreed, Laertes. Our swords cross, not our souls. Mother, watch me.
Gertrude (thinking) His words—sharp as the foils—slice through my worry. If only I could mend his sorrow with laughter, smooth the sharp stones of the past with love. Claudius, eyes narrowed, gestures me to the cup. Such ceremony! Oh, to see Hamlet victorious, his suffering dissipate in the glory of applause.
Claudius (speaking) The first hit! Hamlet, the point is thine. My queen, perhaps you’ll do us honor and offer a toast to the young victor?
Gertrude (speaking) Most gladly, my lord. I pour my heart into this cup as well as wine—here’s to Hamlet, whose spirit burns so brightly that all Denmark is warmed by his flame. Drink to your triumph, my son.
Hamlet (speaking) My lady, I am parched from combat. Yet I would rather drink in your love than any wine.
Gertrude (speaking) I will do the drinking for both of us, then—may fortune favor you, beloved child!
Gertrude (thinking) So sweet, so simple this ritual. I taste only wine on my lips—scented and heady from the goblet’s rim—and think nothing of bitterness, save for regret that cannot taint this moment. Hamlet—his skin aglow with exertion—reminds me of my youth, daring and wild. Does he know the depth of my care?
Claudius (speaking) Nay, my Gertrude—not yet: spare it for Hamlet when the match is ended.
Gertrude (speaking) What harm in wishing him well, my husband? Too little love has clouded these halls of late.
Laertes (speaking) Touché—another hit, Hamlet!
Osric (speaking) The queen drinks to Hamlet—do all see?
Claudius (speaking) (aside) It is the poisoned cup… Stop her, heavens! (aloud) Gertrude, withhold your lips—I pray thee, do not drink.
Gertrude (speaking) Why, my lord? Will you grudge a mother her toast? This cup to Hamlet!
Gertrude (thinking) The wine is rich, more than accustomed, warmth blooming in my center. Claudius’s eyes are wide with worry—a rare thing. What jest is this? Or does some unseen trouble knit his brow?
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, your love makes me strong—see, another pass well-played. The match goes to Denmark!
Laertes (speaking) Well-struck, indeed. Though the court cheers, I feel a darkness gathering at the edges.
Gertrude (thinking) My chest feels tight—strange, as if the wine runs with thunder in its depths. Still, I must show no falter. Hamlet’s triumph belongs to him. Let the shadows bide outside these walls.
Claudius (speaking) (softly, forced) She drinks, she drinks—O God, defend her!
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, if you tremble so at a simple draught, you betray yourself as the worser drinker! (She laughs lightly, though her hand clutches the edge of the throne.)
Hamlet (speaking) Are you unwell, mother? Your face pales.
Gertrude (speaking) No fear, my heart—’tis only the heat of the hall, perhaps, or this excitement. Too much joy for one frail breast! But look, all eyes delight in you, as do mine.
Gertrude (thinking) My breath catches, lungs fluttering like trapped birds. The very air tastes sharp, yet I will not darken the feast with my discomfort. Hamlet, I must appear strong for you—always.
Laertes (speaking) (aside to Claudius) She has drunk the cup! My lord, what have we done?
Claudius (speaking) (aside) It is too late… God have mercy!
Hamlet (speaking) My lady—let me fetch you water.
Gertrude (speaking) Stay, Hamlet—do not leave the field for me. Finish what you began. (Her voice grows softer.) For your mother is ever proud, ever… faithful.
Gertrude (thinking) My head swims. A heat, wild and furious, runs through my veins, tingling to my fingertips. Is it pleasure or pain? My tongue feels heavy, words nestling in the shadowed corners of my mouth, reluctant to emerge.
Hamlet (speaking) Sir, her color fades, and she sways—fetch a physician!
Osric (speaking) A doctor, at once! The queen is unwell!
Gertrude (thinking) Faces blur; I see Hamlet’s eyes, wide and dark and filled with fear. I must not let him see me falter.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet… if aught were amiss, I should tell you. (She musters a smile.) But see, I am steady. Your mother watched you win two rounds—she will watch you win the last.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, be at ease. The match nears its end. All will be well.
Gertrude (thinking) A lie hangs in the air, heavy and cold. Claudius, your words flow over me, slippery and false, but I have no strength to speak my doubt aloud. The pain grows—sudden and monstrous, it knifes through me, steals my breath as surely as the grave.
Laertes (speaking) O Hamlet, beware! The blade is envenomed—the cup, as well! Your mother—
Gertrude (speaking) (cutting him off, her voice trembling) The cup… the cup… O my dear Hamlet! The drink was poisoned.
Gertrude (thinking) The shadows lengthen, filling the vast, echoing hall. My blood turns fire, my limbs slow. I reach with my eyes for Hamlet—let him remember the love in my gaze, not the terror clenching my heart.
Hamlet (speaking) Poisoned—O God! What treachery is this? Mother, hold fast!
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, sweet prince… forgive me my faults. It was love—always love—that guided me astray. Beware the king... the serpent hisses in Eden still.
Gertrude (thinking) Strange comfort, to spill truth at the threshold of night. I see young Hamlet, golden as the dawn, cradled in my arms. Would I could hold him so once more.
Gertrude (speaking) Remember me… not as queen, but as your mother. My life, my heart, are yours—take them and live.
Gertrude (thinking) The cold blossoms within, dulling the pain. The hall grows distant, murmurs and cries washing to silence on invisible tides. My last sight: Hamlet’s face, a wounded cherub, stained with tears and old love.
Hamlet (speaking) O heart, break! Mother, do not leave me! Is there no help, no remedy?
Claudius (speaking) She swoons from fright—attend to her, someone.
Laertes (speaking) The guilt is mine—and yours, my lord. The world will know this day.
Gertrude (thinking) The ceiling glimmers—a great, cold sweep of northern sky. I feel myself slip, not in fear, but in peace, drifting backward to the lullabies I once sang. Love—that was the balm, that is the mark I leave. If these my last words kindle hope in Hamlet, my time is well spent.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, live for love. Let your anger die with me; cherish life, though it wounds you.
Gertrude (thinking) Now, at the edge—soft as the linen of his childhood blankets—I surrender everything. Let love’s memory guide him clear of hate.
Hamlet (speaking) O God, O God! My mother, lost to foul cunning!
Claudius (speaking) Madness! The queen is gone!
Laertes (speaking) Her death is on us both; may Denmark’s sorrow cleanse this poisoned court.
Gertrude (thinking) The pain fades. I am light, unmoored, flying wingless. Hamlet, child of my heart, may you find peace where I did not. Farewell—
(Gertrude’s vision dims, her final thought a whisper folded in the hush that settles over the room, fragile and enduring as a mother’s love.)"
distressed,Gertrude collapses and declares she has been poisoned.,"Background: Gertrude collapses and declares she has been poisoned.
Gertrude (thinking) My mouth is dry, my limbs are trembling—the world is spinning and everyone is staring, expectant, frightened, or else oblivious to this agony now pouring, burning through my chest. I need them to hear me, to understand before it is too late; I need them to know what’s been done, what I’ve realized too late. My vision narrows and I clutch the armrest, shivering, unwilling to die in the margins, unheard and unloved. Is this how it ends? This unspeakable pain, this utter betrayal?
Gertrude (speaking) No—No! Stop! Do you not see? My heart clutches; I—my veins are fire! I am poisoned—someone—someone has poisoned me!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! What did you say? Poisoned? By whom? Who did this to you—speak, speak, I beg you, do not falter now!
Claudius (speaking) Poisoned? What nonsense is this—Gertrude, you are unwell, you drank too quickly. Sit, compose yourself, do not give in to panic.
Gertrude (thinking) He is lying—a mask, cold, arrogant, knowing full well what’s coursing through me. Does he think I cannot taste the death in my mouth, the bitterness crawling up my tongue? Claudius—my husband, my jailer. Hamlet’s eyes—panicked, searching mine for the truth, for an anchor. If only I could tell him everything. Is he ready for the truth in my final breath?
Gertrude (speaking) No—it burns, it eats at me—this cup, the wine—I watched you, Claudius, pass it to me—did you not? Or was it for Hamlet? The taste—God, the taste of it! There is murder here, there is murder in this hall!
Horatio (speaking) Hamlet—she is ill, truly ill. Her skin pales, her lips—look! She is not feigning.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, what did you see? Who gave you the cup? Was it the king?—answer, please, answer, before it’s too late!
Gertrude (thinking) My son’s voice wavers—he believes me at last! The world spins and contracts, nothing but their faces—distorted by horror, fear, denial. My tongue feels thick, my throat closes. Why am I so afraid? Was this what they intended for him? Oh, to have failed to protect my own flesh, my only child—to become the pawn in this monstrous game...
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet—my precious son—beware! The cup, the cup! It is death—intended for you, I see it in his eyes, your uncle’s eyes! My God, forgive me—I did not know, I did not see until now!
Claudius (speaking) Enough! You are raving, woman—cease this madness. Guards, fetch a physician, someone restrain her!
Horatio (speaking) She is dying, Hamlet—look! Her hands—blackened at the nails, her breath so shallow!
Hamlet (speaking) No, no, no! Mother—stay with me! Look at me, do not leave—tell me more! Was it Claudius? Was he your murderer, or mine?
Gertrude (thinking) My limbs grow heavy, my vision dances; if only I could gather my last strength for one final plea. Hamlet must survive—he must escape this wretched fate, see through the lies that have suffocated me for years. The truth—they must know the truth, even if it is the last gift I give.
Gertrude (speaking) My vision blurs, Hamlet, but I see you—so bright, so brave. I drank the poison, and it was meant for you, I am sure. Beware your uncle—he is no friend, no husband, no kin but a serpent. Promise me—you will not drink, you will watch every word, every shadow. I am sorry, my son—I am sorry for every moment of ignorance, for every lie I swallowed, for every night I turned away. My heart—it aches with regret.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, hold on—do not go! Your words are the truth, I hear you—and I will not touch another drop! Uncle—villain! Is it not clear? See her choking, and still you sit with your silences and your schemes!
Claudius (speaking) This is madness—these accusations are the product of delirium! All assembled here, do not listen to this slander. She is unwell—she has always been feeble, fragile in constitution!
Gertrude (thinking) Coward. Even now, he will not ease my passing with truth—no, he buries me with lies, as he did my husband. But the hall has changed; I see suspicion and horror—no one believes him now. My legacy will be this: I have spoken the truth. May it light a torch in Hamlet’s mind and all who witness this evil.
Gertrude (speaking) Friends—courtiers—witnesses all—you know me, you have seen me in joy and sorrow. Hear me now, on the edge of darkness: Claudius is a liar, a murderer. He has poisoned me with his own hand! If you have hearts, let them rage. If you have eyes, let them unmask him! I die, but let truth live!
Horatio (speaking) Hamlet—listen! Her words are clear enough; she points to the king himself—what say you now, Claudius?
Osric (speaking) The queen is dead, or nearly so—whose hand will answer for her suffering?
Gertrude (thinking) They are crying out, all of them. I hear it as in a tunnel, voices warped and distant. My body is ice at the edges; the center aches, a great heaviness squeezing out every last memory, every last love. I am not ready to leave, my boy—I am not ready to cast myself into silence. If I could hold you, Hamlet, one more time, warn you more, forgive you everything—will you forgive me for the blindness that brought us here?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet—do not hate me. Whatever comes, I have loved you with all my brokenness. I go to your father. Remember—remember—remember...
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Oh, mother—her pulse is gone! Her lips do not move! Claudius—do you see what you have done? Is there no justice left in Elsinore? Is there no end to this blood and poison?
Claudius (speaking) I—this is a riot, a fevered pack. Guards—seize Hamlet! Clear the hall—do not listen to these fever-dreams!
Laertes (speaking) The queen is dead by poison! And was it not I who warned of such plots? There is guilt in this room, and it rests at the kingdom’s very heart!
Horatio (speaking) Gertrude is gone, but her confession lingers—a shadow over every soul here. Hamlet—take heed, let not grief unseat you.
Gertrude (thinking) If I could swim backward through the river of time, would I change all? He will weep, my poor son. He will rage, accuse, perhaps die. The rooms will echo with my words: Poison, murder, treachery. May they rattle to the rafters until someone is brave enough to shatter this circle of evil. My chest is heavy, but already, in death, it begins to lift—what is earth but longing for release?
Gertrude (speaking) My eyes are closing—the world floats far, far off below me. This is my end—remember the truth, remember—
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! I swear by your spirit, I will avenge you. I will see the wound in Denmark cleansed, if I perish in the act!
Horatio (speaking) She has passed, Hamlet. Let us carry her with honor, and let not her last warning go unanswered.
Claudius (speaking) Treason! Madness! All is confusion—do not let them sway you, loyal subjects! I am your king—loyalty is your duty!
Gertrude (thinking) It is done. Night falls. My son cries out. I pray my suffering buys him hope, that he will live long enough to break these chains. Farewell, Hamlet—farewell, betrayal, farewell, my lonely throne. I am free—finally, free.
Gertrude (speaking) (softly, barely audible, to Hamlet) Forgive me... live... live...
Hamlet (speaking) I will, mother. Your suffering shall not be in vain—this hall shall know justice before the dawn.
Horatio (speaking) The queen is dead, and Denmark shall never be the same.
Gertrude (thinking) Darkness, silence, rest. But let the truth I have spoken burn brighter than any light that came before."
misguided,"Believing Hamlet is winning, Gertrude drinks the poisoned cup meant for Hamlet and dies.","As the duel between Hamlet and Laertes rages and the crowd hovers on the edge of anticipation, Gertrude, swept up in hope for her son’s triumph, lifts the goblet poisoned by Claudius, convinced she’s toasting Hamlet’s victory.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The room is tense, heavy with voices echoing against stone and heartbeats quickening beneath finery. My son, alive in the ring of swords, hair disheveled and eyes so bright—he fights as if led by fate. How proud I am! He has turned the tide—surely, this is the moment for celebration. Still, there’s a strange chill in the air; Claudius’s hand trembled as he filled the cup, but surely it is only the pressure of the crowd and the clamor.
Claudius (speaking)  
Give him the cup, Gertrude—let Hamlet refresh himself from the sport.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Ah, my husband’s voice—insistent, too eager by far. What danger hovers in the corners of his tone? Yet I must not falter. Hamlet deserves applause, not suspicion in the midst of triumph.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I am not yet weary, mother. Save the cup for the victor.
Laertes (speaking)  
A hit, a palpable hit! Yet the Prince looks stronger than ever. Is this not a day of miracles?
Gertrude (speaking)  
(raising the goblet high, her voice ringing clear) He does! Hamlet, you are bold in battle and graceful beneath watchful eyes. This draught I toast to your honor and fortune! Let Denmark see you crown’d in glory.
Claudius (speaking)  
Gertrude, do not drink!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Why does he startle so violently? His eyes dart, glassy with worry. What secret shadows cross my lord’s brow? My throat is parched with joy and unease alike. Still, what harm in a mother’s cheer?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Let her commend me, my lord, as mothers ought. Guiltless words and wine are all the armor I require.
Laertes (speaking)  
Peace, my King. The match grows fierce, but we are hardly at an end.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(determined, a quiver in her voice that betrays both resolve and uncertainty) I will drink regardless. The fates themselves cannot turn us from celebration—too much darkness has shadowed our halls, and tonight, light returns.
Claudius (speaking)  
It is the poisoned cup—it is too late!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Poisoned? The word hammers in my ears, ringing false—surely he jests, trying to dampen joy with caution. Yet something chills within my bones, a slither of fear that coils around my heart. 
Gertrude (speaking)  
Poisoned... no, no, it cannot be. This cup gleams with hope, not venom. Hamlet, your mother drinks to you—see how bravely fortune smiles?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, what have you done? You look pale—speak to me.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The wine burns, oddly harsh—my tongue numb, my fingertips tingling like frost on flesh. A distant echo drums up memories: laughter in Elsinore’s corridors, Hamlet’s tiny hand in mine, his first steps. The world wobbles at its edges, blurred as storm-wet glass. Is this what Claudius feared? Have I erred, not in faith but in blindness?
Gertrude (speaking)  
(she stumbles, voice faltering yet desperate to reassure) No harm, my son—pay them no mind, nor look at me with worry. ’Tis merely the rush of pride, the heat of crowded halls. Continue the match, Hamlet—win this for us, for Denmark.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, you faint—your lips are blue! Help! Hold her, the Queen is swooning!
Laertes (speaking)  
What dark game is this? The Queen collapses at the peak of revelry—no common dizziness this. Her breath is short—her eyes roll white. 
Claudius (speaking)  
Gertrude, my love—speak, I implore you. This disaster was never meant for you... oh, gods!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Everything narrows, vision fading to lines of candlelight and shimm’ring tears. I taste regret, bitter as wormwood. Did I misstep on a mother’s love? Have I—oh, what coil of venom clings to my veins? With each heartbeat, my world scurries away from me.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(she grasps Hamlet’s arm, feeble but insistent) Forgive me, Hamlet. Sweet boy—O, I did not know... your father’s shadow lingers—beware the King, beware the worm beneath the rose. May my folly save you—do not drink, do not trust.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother—what have you seen? What worm? Tell me, tell me all! Stay with me, mother!
Gertrude (thinking)  
No air—each breath a choked sob. My limbs are stone, the body fails, and words fumble away. But I must speak. I must. Through this agony, the image of my dead husband rises—his finger to his lips, warning, warning! I see it now. Gertrude, how late you waken.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(voice reduced to a strained whisper) The cup was not for me. Claudius... trust him not. I see his guilt, clear at last—my eyes are unclouded by hope. Hamlet—avenge, but be gentle. I loved, though wrongly. Remember me as I was, not as I failed.
Claudius (speaking)  
She raves—her wits are undone. Pay her no heed—let her be removed!
Laertes (speaking)  
No, my lord, this is no madness born of fancy. The Queen convulses as no faintness or fever could compel.
Hamlet (speaking)  
A villain, then—O villain, thou art damned! You poisoned the Queen for me!
Gertrude (thinking)  
I drift; Hamlet’s voice is like an anchor in a sea of pain, but the undertow is so strong. I want to weep, to cling to him as when he was but a child. A mother should protect—should have seen—should have known! No comfort left but confession.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(she heaves, every word an ordeal) I meant only joy, only hope. Can a mother’s love be so blinding? Take warning, Hamlet—all that glitters, all that smiles, hides rot beneath. The crown is cursed—your path is perilous. Remember... remember...
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother! Mother, speak! Do not leave me—oh, you gods! Her eyes are glass, her lips cold. Will no one help? This poison works too true.
Laertes (speaking)  
She loved you still, Prince. What better motivator for revenge? The King’s cup was seeded—this plot runs deeper than any of us guessed.
Claudius (speaking)  
Guards, seize the Prince! The match is ruined—fetch a physician!
Gertrude (thinking)  
My sight is gone, my body numb. Yet something rises—peace? Yes, in spite of all, release washes through, cool and silver. If only I had known, if only—no, enough regret. Let my last act be warning, however late.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(inaudible, barely more than a sigh) Protect... protect him...
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother—gone. Ere sunrise comes, Denmark will shake. The poison—foul and traitorous—has claimed its innocent.
Laertes (speaking)  
Let justice be done, Hamlet, for both our mothers now sleep untimely.
Claudius (speaking)  
The Queen has fallen—a tragedy! But I, your King, command order!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Darkness closes in, sounds muffled and far. But somewhere, a child’s laughter—my boy—echoes, fleeting and bright. I cling to that light as the world slips away. If my passing means his awakening, let it be. Let it be.
Gertrude (speaking)  
(feebly, as life ebbs) Hamlet... my son...
Laertes (speaking)  
Too much blood, too many secrets!
Hamlet (speaking)  
No more stains, no more delay—justice shall answer every sin as dawn approaches!
Gertrude (thinking)  
Final warmth—perhaps the sun, perhaps a memory. If only love had been wisdom, if only! But even error may teach, and death may heal. I rest in hope, if not in peace. 
Gertrude (speaking)  
(gone, voice a mere shadow) Farewell."
angry,Gertrude summons Hamlet to her quarters to reprimand him for his behavior at the play.,"Gertrude has summoned Hamlet to her private chambers after the play, seething over the spectacle he caused in front of the court and her new husband.
Gertrude (thinking) How dare he! How dare my own son defile the memory of his father by behaving so—so monstrously, openly, in view of all Denmark! He knows how thin the ice beneath us is, and yet he insists on hammering with his heels. What does he want? Ruin? My house shamed, my crown trembling, my heart pierced yet again? No more—no more. Tonight I will make him see reason, or I will see him cowed. He must understand the limits of a mother’s patience.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet! Shut that door and stand before me. Explain yourself. What possessed you to lash out so wildly, to humiliate your uncle, your king—and me—before the whole court with that display? Have you any shred of respect left for your mother?
Hamlet (speaking) Madam, I do not know how to answer you as a child should answer a parent. My mind is boiling, and the poison that chokes my father’s memory leaves me blind to pageantry and poisoned revels.
Gertrude (speaking) Poison? Must every word from you drip with fresh accusation? You saw fit to make a spectacle, to gnash and mock as if the palace were a pit for your wild dogs. You showed no measure, no decency, Hamlet. Curse your clever tongue! Have you forgotten yourself, or worse—forgotten me?
Hamlet (speaking) Forgotten you, madam? No. But have you forgotten my father, whom you wore on your heart not two months dead? Must I clap and dance while my uncle wears his crown and his hands still smell of old blood?
Gertrude (speaking) Enough! These are vile insinuations. You speak of blood—what of the shame you have brought upon your own blood tonight? You threw barbs at Claudius, and by extension you wound your mother, who has suffered enough. How dare you accuse us all and play at innocence?
Hamlet (speaking) It was your wedding, madam, that soured the air and choked me near unto death. If I am not innocent, it is because my eyes are pried wide to sickness. I see too much. I cannot unsee.
Gertrude (speaking) And do you suppose you alone have suffered loss? You are not the sole mourner in this castle, Hamlet. Year after year, I have shaped myself around old wounds—your father’s absences, now his death, and the rotting of this family’s very roots. And yet I strive for peace and continuity! You would rather burn it all down in your grief.
Hamlet (speaking) I want truth—only truth, even if it shatters me. How quickly you’ve grown accustomed to your new station, madam. Were my father’s steps so easily filled?
Gertrude (speaking) Insolent! How dare you judge me with those eyes, as if you know my heart—my nights of waking, my hours pacing these same stones you now spit upon. If you cannot contain yourself, you will bring down the very roof over our heads.
Gertrude (thinking) Why does he not see? There is danger in every word, every suspicion. If he raises doubt in the court, Claudius will brook no more defiance. He terrifies me—my son. My flesh, now turned stranger. I must either drag him from this ledge or become complicit in his undoing.
Gertrude (speaking) I command you: swear you will end this madness. Promise you will not mock your stepfather nor stoke flames in public again. If you care for your own life, heed me!
Hamlet (speaking) You threaten me now? My own mother? You would protect the king above your own blood?
Gertrude (speaking) I would protect order! I would keep my family from being torn asunder for the delight of gossiping courtiers. You leave me little choice. Your grief has curdled into contempt, and now it poisons the very air I breathe. Must I choose between you and stability? Must I?
Hamlet (speaking) Perhaps stability is nothing more than an illusion built over a grave. You fear unrest more than injustice.
Gertrude (speaking) I fear annihilation, Hamlet. I fear the howling of the dogs that gather when a house falters. I fear for you. If you keep tearing at these wounds, they will fester and kill us all.
Gertrude (thinking) Control—control is slipping from me. Every word with him is a battle, a duel not of swords but of hearts. I want to strike him, to shake him until he sees reason, but I see his pain—so raw. What have I made of him, of myself? Still, I cannot yield.
Gertrude (speaking) You will not accuse me again. I warn you. I am your mother, Hamlet, and what remains of your father’s name. If you force me to it, I will call the guard. I will see you silenced before you destroy us all.
Hamlet (speaking) Would you really? You would have your only child caged, exiled—killed, if need be—to defend your hasty marriage and your comfort?
Gertrude (speaking) You dare! You—ungrateful wretch! All I have done, all I have borne—do not speak to me of comfort! I have no comfort. I have only the burden of keeping this kingdom from turning upon itself while you gnaw at it from within.
Hamlet (speaking) Maybe the kingdom deserves the truth. Maybe the world deserves to know what rots at its center.
Gertrude (speaking) Truth is not your weapon, Hamlet. It is a torch in hands as reckless as yours, and it will burn you along with the rest. Do you understand? Our positions are not toys. I am the Queen. You are the Prince. There are eyes everywhere—words have weight. Your bared grief has consequences.
Hamlet (speaking) If consequence is the price for honesty, then let it fall. I am through with acting.
Gertrude (speaking) No, you are not through until I say you are! You will obey me, Hamlet! You will recall your duty—not just as my son, but as a prince of Denmark! I did not raise you for this—a rebel, a poison-tongued wraith shadowing our every step.
Gertrude (thinking) He must relent. I have lost too much already. I will not lose my place, my name, to the black tides of his suspicion. I must contain him, bend him back to the path, or see all destroyed.
Gertrude (speaking) Kneel, Hamlet. Renounce your disrespect and swear you will uphold what little harmony we have left—swear it before I am forced to act against you.
Hamlet (speaking) I cannot swear to what I do not believe, mother. I will not play the blind man while conscience gnaws at my soul. If my silence is the price of your love, then take it—I will not pay.
Gertrude (speaking) Then you set yourself against your own mother. Are you so lost to yourself that you would see me as an enemy?
Hamlet (speaking) I do not see you as enemy, mother, but as one lost, as I am. We are both adrift in this sea of treachery and lies. But I will not drown quietly.
Gertrude (speaking) God above, you are impossible! Impossible! For once, will you not be my son—just my son? Must you always be his ghost?
Hamlet (speaking) I am both—yours and his. That is my curse.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough… enough of your riddles. I am your mother! Do you hear me? I birthed you! Your blood runs with mine—you cannot cast me off, nor spit upon my name for all the world to see.
Gertrude (thinking) My hands… they tremble. He sees it. The son I cradled now glowers back at me, stranger and beloved both. What poison have we poured into one another? Does he want my heart to break in two? Yet I see a shadow of the man I hoped my Hamlet to be—fearless and wild. But fear will not keep him safe.
Gertrude (speaking) Presume upon my patience a moment further and you will find it gone. I have given you chance after chance, understanding beyond reason. But you cross one line more, Hamlet, and even I cannot save you.
Hamlet (speaking) Do what you must, mother. My heart can weather more storms yet.
Gertrude (speaking) So be it! Go. Get from my sight before I curse you in earnest. And God have mercy on us both, for we are both undone.
Hamlet (speaking) Farewell, mother. Remember me when the storm comes.
Gertrude (thinking) He is gone. The chamber feels colder. Was this the end of us? My rage empties me, leaves only dread behind. Yet—I could not bend, not tonight. If kingdoms are built on mothers’ backs, it is only because our spines grow iron in the fire. I cannot save him, nor can I destroy him, and so perhaps I will lose all. But I will not yield. Not now. Not ever."
fearful and convinced,Gertrude cannot see the ghost and believes that Hamlet is truly mad.,"In this moment, Gertrude stands face-to-face with her son Hamlet, who raves and gestures violently at an empty corner, speaking as though another soul were present, while she herself sees nothing but his apparent madness and is overwhelmed by terror and conviction that her only son is lost to reason.
Gertrude (thinking)  
What cold thrums at my breast! I see him—dear Hamlet—his eyes wild, his limbs all a-tremble, yet the air about us stands clear, unstirred by ghost or shadow. Can it be sickness of the mind? O what god will shield me now, with my blood so chilled, my soul untethered by his frenzy!
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet, what wilt thou do? Why dost thou fix thy gaze upon that void and speak as though some foul specter stood there? There is nothing, nothing but empty air. I beseech thee, look on me—thy mother! Come back to yourself and forsake this dreadful rage.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, look! Do you see nothing there? Upon your very closet’s edge? His visage—grave, sorrowful, imploring! Dost thou not mark his finger, upraised in silent accusation?
Gertrude (thinking)  
He quakes, his voice tangled and desperate, yet naught do I perceive. Out, out! All comfort leeched; he is lost, undone. This is not my son but some wild stranger.
Gertrude (speaking)  
I see nothing, Hamlet. I see no face—save your own twisted with a feverish dread—and no hand but the trembling one you lift yourself. O my child, speak not so wildly. Each word tears at my heart, a mother’s heart too frail to bear this tempest.
Hamlet (speaking)  
You cannot see? O heavens, what blindness is this? My father, armed and grave, stands before us—he bids me remember! Why art thou thus insensible, sealed to his presence while I burn with the knowledge that murders and poisons prowl our house?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Stop. Stop this, I beg. No ghost appears to me, nor any baby-face but yours—and now you frighten me, dear heart, as I have never been frightened before. Is it the fever of your mind, brought on by too much sorrow? Do you imagine things only you can see? I pray you, lay aside these cruel phantoms.
Hamlet (speaking)  
You do not hear him, either? Mother, in God’s name—he cries for vengeance! He bids me speak daggers! But soft, I must not rend your soul with harsher truths. And yet, I must. You must needs know how you have wrong’d both him and me.
Gertrude (thinking)  
He rails, he sees shapes and hears voices, but to me the room is cold and stark in its emptiness. My flesh crawls with the terror of every mother who must watch her child slip from her grasp, devoured by shadows she cannot touch. What poison infects his wits?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not speak daggers to me, Hamlet! I cannot endure it! I am sick at heart. My eyes see only misery, my ears ring with your woe. If there is some evil haunting you, let me call physicians, priests—any man of science or faith, if only they can soothe you back to peace!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Call no one but your conscience, madam. Let not the canker of Denmark’s throne leak further rot into this chamber. My father’s spirit bids me find remedy—not physic nor prayer, but just retribution.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Retribution? My sweet boy, speak plainly! What injury do you nurse that cries so loud it draws phantoms from the grave? If thy reason is unseated—if some monstrous grief now clutches at your brain—then let me comfort you, and hold you as I did when you were small.
Hamlet (speaking)  
My soul is heavy, mother, but not disordered—though your eyes see only madness! That is the curse: that evil done by day’s broad light is cloaked in night’s confusion, so those who would see must first be thought mad. You will not believe me. No matter—there are truths that haunt the blood, unbidden.
Gertrude (thinking)  
He grows stranger still. Alas, is not sorrow enough? Must all the world dissolve to nightmare? Will no one deliver me from this terror, this loss, this dreadful unknown snatching at my only child?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You torment me, Hamlet! My heart is bruised, my mind confounded. I cannot follow your wild fancies down all these shadowed corridors. No ghost has entered here unless it be the ghost of your former self—changed and sorrowful and strange. Tell me, what would you have me do, if I could not see your vision nor share your fears?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Confess, mother. Unburden your soul of its guilt. Think upon my father: recall his love, his gentle rule, the quick demise—all twisted by foul ambition and lust. You married with unseemly haste, you sat beside my uncle with blood scarcely dry upon my father’s shroud.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough! Stop these cruel accusations, Hamlet. I cannot bear the sting of your words. I am but flesh and blood—weak, confused, seeking only shelter and warmth. How could I know what snares enclosed me? O God, why do you visit such wrath upon me in the face of my beloved son?
Hamlet (speaking)  
You have eyes, yet see not. You have ears, but you hear not. My father’s spirit breathes in every sigh of wind, in every cold shadow cast upon this floor—even though your sight, dulled by comfort, marks nothing amiss.
Gertrude (thinking)  
He ravages me with these words. I cling to my fear as to a rock in a flood—if I let it go, I am swept away, drowned in the madness that claims him.
Gertrude (speaking)  
You frighten me, Hamlet! I fear you mean yourself some harm—or worse, that you will lose forever your gentle reason. If you love me, my son, come back to the world I know. Speak to me plainly, as once you did, and I will do whatever lies in a mother’s power to make you whole again.
Hamlet (speaking)  
My mind is too troubled for plainer words, mother. The truth is poison to unprepared lips. Pray, do not harden your heart to pity, nor close your mind to what you cannot see. I must act, though you think me mad. Forgive me my vehemence.
Gertrude (speaking)  
I cannot—O God, I cannot! My heart breaks for you, and I tremble for ELSINORE, for all our souls seem haunted now—yet I see no cause but the wound in your mind. I will not believe in ghosts and vengeful spirits, Hamlet. Only in you—my lost, suffering child.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Then let me be so—lost and suffering, if that must buy truth. Know this, mother: you are complicit, if only by your blindness. But I love you still—more than you can know—and it is that love, not madness, that fuels my agony.
Gertrude (thinking)  
His words—so fierce, so forlorn! My heart aches with terror and love twisted tight together, and I am rendered powerless, a queen undone by fear of her own son.
Gertrude (speaking)  
O Hamlet, whatever shadows pursue you, whatever phantoms steer your words, I beg you—rest awhile. Lie down and allow your spirit to mend. I will have torches brought, and men to keep us company until dawn. You shall not be alone, nor will I abandon you to whatever darkness haunts your heart.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Do as you think best, mother. But know—the dawn brings only the reckoning nearer, and no tender watch can bar out what I must do. Farewell for now. If you cannot see the ghost, remember instead the living flesh that stands before you, battered by invisible storms.
Gertrude (thinking)  
The walls seem to close in, the air tingled with menace. I watch him go, a man possessed, and I am lost—stranded between love for my child and horror at what he has become. O God, let this cup pass from me—I am afraid, and certain he is lost to madness.
Gertrude (speaking)  
God preserve us both, Hamlet. May angels guard you in this tempest. I… I will pray for the morning, and hope its light chases away these dreadful hallucinations. Until then, I am yours—all I can give, frightened though I am, is love.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Love is enough—for now. Remember me, mother. Remember.
Gertrude (thinking)  
He is gone, and the silence echoes with accusation and dread. I am left haunted not by ghosts, but by loss—and the certitude that our world is unmoored, spinning, terrifying, and strange.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
O Hamlet, O my poor boy… what am I to do?"
angry,Gertrude summons Hamlet to confront him about his inappropriate behavior at the play.,"The background: Gertrude summons Hamlet to confront him about his inappropriate behavior at the play.
Gertrude (thinking) How dare he—how dare my own son hurl such poison at the man I married, at me, no less. Before the court—before the King. It is one thing to suspect him troubled, another to have him shame me, jeopardize everything I have fought to keep standing. My heart races, blood burns in my temples. I cannot—will not—allow him to continue with this madness.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet! Sit down. Now. I am your mother, and by God, you will answer for your disgraceful display at the play. What madness possesses you to act in such a fashion—do you seek to destroy me before the court? To drag my name through the mud—your father’s memory, what is left of our family?
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, you call it madness; I call it truth. Would you have me smile and nod, feigning delight while the rot festers beneath your gold-threaded canopy? Or perhaps you’d rather I held my tongue—as everybody else seems content to wallow in comforting lies.
Gertrude (thinking) His insolence, his barbed words—he knows how to cut deepest. He is still my son, my own flesh, but at this moment he feels as much stranger as kin. My fingers tighten on the arm of the chair. I must keep my composure, for if I let rage spill outright, I grant him power. He wants a reaction; he will not have all of me.
Gertrude (speaking) Spare me your riddles and half-truths, Hamlet! Did you think yourself clever, taunting the King with that play—plastering your suspicions for all to see? You have made us mockery in our own hall! Have you no respect for your family, for me? Am I so little to you now?
Hamlet (speaking) Respect? For whom—my father, murdered in cold blood? Or for you, who wed with unseemly haste the snake who shed his brother’s skin? If I am harsh, it is because you stand complicit. Or blind, if not worse. Why else should the Queen quail at the sound of conscience?
Gertrude (thinking) He stings—he wounds me with every word, each reminder of the blood and betrayal that sits between me and the world. I ache with anger, but beneath it, a whimper of guilt. Should I deny it? Refute him, or drag him back to sense? He corners me like a rat; I must assert control.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough! You presume too far, Hamlet! Your accusations are wild, and your grief spins tales that border upon lunacy. I am still your mother—and you will show me the reverence due! I have lost as much as you. I have bled, I have wept, I have endured. Do not imagine yourself alone in this.
Hamlet (speaking) Then why do you hide behind false cheer and new crowns, Mother? You have not mourned—no, you have celebrated! The ink scarce dry on my father’s will, and already his brother sits in his chair, wears his crown—and you, you in his bed!
Gertrude (thinking) The memory of King Hamlet, my Hamlet’s father, presses upon me. Yes, I remarried, yes, I sought comfort—was I to live in perpetual shadow? Does he truly believe me heartless, soulless? My pride screams in protest; I will not have my love or weakness dissected by a boy playing at avenger.
Gertrude (speaking) You know nothing of a woman’s grief, nor the weight I must bear! You see betrayal everywhere—have you considered that perhaps I sought peace, solace, protection for myself and for you, my son? You see everything as treachery, Hamlet, because you would rather blame than understand!
Hamlet (speaking) Understand? What is there to understand, save that the world is out of joint and those meant to set it right are content to let it rot? I see you, and I see a mother who will not look her son in the eye, nor answer for the ghost that haunts her footsteps.
Gertrude (thinking) This ghost, this phantom—he leaks madness into my son’s very soul. Why can he not see what this vengeance is doing to him? Perhaps he is truly mad. My hands tremble; I clench them in my lap. I must not let him twist my purpose, turn me from the strength that holds my sanity.
Gertrude (speaking) You invoke ghosts and shadows, Hamlet, but real men and women pay the price for your obsessions! You risk all—you risk your life, my safety, the stability of the realm. Do you wish to bring ruin upon us both? Must your bitterness poison everything that remains?
Hamlet (speaking) Poison? There’s poison here, true—the kind that seeps, unnoticed, through marriage beds and bloodlines. You think I threaten us? Speak to your own heart, Mother. Ask where your conscience cowers. Would you rather have your son lie to you, join the sycophants, or speak as plainly as he bleeds?
Gertrude (thinking) He forces memories I wish buried—questions I have never fully faced. Do I carry some guilt? Or is this merely his grief, seeking a culprit? I rage at him for his arrogance, but fear coiled within me whispers that he may not be wholly wrong. No, I cannot let it show—I must harden, or I will be swept away by his tempest.
Gertrude (speaking) I will not be your scapegoat, nor your confessor! Your father is dead—and nothing you say, nothing I do, can change that fate. I have made my choice. You must accept the world as it is, or be destroyed by your refusal. Do not dare to heap all your sorrow and suspicion onto me!
Hamlet (speaking) So you would turn the blame from yourself with royal impatience. You will not answer my anger, only child it away. Tell me then—look me in the eyes, Mother—were you honest with my father? Have you been honest with yourself, with me?
Gertrude (thinking) He traps me, corners me. His eyes—so like his father’s, but fierce and accusing. I know, I know, for all my indignation, something seethes beneath. The answers I do not give, the comfort I cannot offer. How did it come to this—my son, my enemy?
Gertrude (speaking) What would you have me say, Hamlet? That I am blameless, pure? I am not! I am human—I have erred, I have chosen. I did not kill your father, nor did I force the world into cruelty. I did what I thought I must, for this throne, and for you.
Hamlet (speaking) Then own your choices, Mother! Look upon them—see them as I do, not through the haze of excuses and royal duties. If the choice was survival over mourning, then say so! If love made you blind—admit it! But do not hide behind the trappings of state and expect me to bow.
Gertrude (thinking) He will not yield, will not grant me peace. I cannot – I will not apologize for seeking life after death, for holding this kingdom together when all wanted to tear it apart. But gods, he leaves me shaken—his words like daggers, opening old wounds. If he hopes to break me, he will find I am not so brittle.
Gertrude (speaking) I tire of your accusations. You would see our house pulled down, our honor shredded, rather than accept imperfection. Your father’s death has made you cruel, Hamlet. You see monsters everywhere you look. Perhaps you should ask yourself why you cannot move on—why your grief festers instead of heals.
Hamlet (speaking) I grieve because I remember what was lost. I rage because no one else dares to name what was stolen, or who profits from it. I will not play the smiling courtier—not for you, not for the King. If that brands me mad or cruel, then so be it. At least I am honest.
Gertrude (thinking) Honesty—his banner and his weapon both. What honesty demands of me, I dread to contemplate. But if I yield now, I surrender authority; if I refuse, perhaps I lose him forever. Fury crackles in my chest, intertwined with pain.
Gertrude (speaking) Leave my sight. I cannot—will not—hear more of this from you. Go before I say something I regret. If you care for me at all, Hamlet, leave me in peace. Think upon your words—and the damage they do.
Hamlet (speaking) You would rather silence me than face the truth. But I will not go quietly, Mother. Remember—there are wounds which fester in silence. And the play is not over, not yet.
Gertrude (thinking) His words linger, sharp and unrelenting. I ache with anger, but beneath it, sorrow—fear for him, for myself, for this whole broken court. He storms away, but I am left with all that still must be faced, and a heart heavier for every word spoken. If only love could be armor. If only truth did not cut so deep."

Gertrude (thinking) The lantern guttered and sent monstrous shadows stalking the corners. The air lies heavy and thick, and my son is bowed as if he bears the world’s weight upon his back. Is this madness? What horror has hollowed his eyes so?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, what words are these? To whom do you deliver your fevered speech—there is no one here but me. Your voice startles; it echoes against cold stone and emptiness.
Hamlet (speaking) Do you not see him? Look, mother! His grave-pale hand bids me attend. His brows knit with such trouble—it is my father’s face! Do not avert your eyes; do you not see?
Gertrude (speaking) No, my son, I see no face but yours! You look at the air as though something stares back, but there is naught—nothing—nothing. You shake, your breath is bitten off in mid-cry. What’s haunting you, Hamlet?
Hamlet (speaking) He comes with accusation, a shadow charged with wrongs that burn like fire. His robe drips night; his eyes are tomb-cold. Did you not hear his voice thunder, ‘Remember me!’?
Gertrude (thinking) My heart hammers a desperate rhythm—could I but see a fraction of what wrings him so. If there is a presence, it hides itself from me; if there is madness, I cradle it in my arms, my son.
Gertrude (speaking) You frighten me, Hamlet! Your features contort as if in great pain, but I see nothing, hear nothing—as though you stand on a bridge across a black dividing sea. What is it you see that I cannot?
Hamlet (speaking) He bears a wound unstaunched, mother, a wound that bleeds complaint. He fixes me with a charge: “Speak not of me to her, but let her to her own conscience whisper.” But I must speak, I must! Mother! His hand points, implores—do you feel nothing? Not a chill, not the brush of distant grave-wind?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, you edge backwards as if driven from your place by invisible threat. You fix your gaze above—what dwells there? I see a bare wall, wracked by candle-shade. There is no presence but ours!
Hamlet (speaking) He is going—no, come back! My father, pause! I will not falter—I will act as you require! Oh, do not fade!
Gertrude (speaking) There is nothing! Nothing but the emptiness of your madness and my terror. I beg you tell me, what ails you? Am I losing a son as I once lost a husband? Speak to me, Hamlet, speak to me as you did before this night.
Hamlet (speaking) I am not mad, mother. I know not how I appear—wild-eyed, breathless, wrecked. But were you to see what I do, you would fall down shuddering. Believe me honest: it is my father’s spirit. He walked the ramparts, spoke to me in the starlit gloom, charged me with his murder!
Gertrude (thinking) Is this fever, some black affliction wrought by grief too long chained or guilt too deeply hid? I remember him as a boy, laughter tumbling in the garden sun. Have I wrought this? Have I broken what I love most?
Gertrude (speaking) My poor Hamlet. You see daggers where I see only empty air and haunted longing. There is no murder here but silence grown monstrous between us. You say your father’s spirit roams—what would he demand of his trembling son?
Hamlet (speaking) He comes not to harm you—his words flinch from you, mother, perhaps for love or piety’s sake. But he charges me with vengeance: “Let not the royal bed of Denmark be a couch for lust and damned incest.” He would have me act. Yet, mother, I am bound, twisted upon the rack of conscience.
Gertrude (speaking) You speak riddles, Hamlet! What venom sours your tongue to call your birthbed damned? What secret coils round your soul and squeezes such horror from your voice? Who poisons your mind against me?
Hamlet (speaking) O, what a rash and bloody deed! Mother, do you not see? My father was murdered—all smiles and pledges but behind them, corruption and quick death. The serpent that stung him now wears his crown. Do you not feel the chill of treason?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, your words freeze my marrow. Is this the root of your torment—this suspicion, this wild, dreadful accusation? My son, my soul aches. I've done no murder. Your fear makes a specter of me.
Hamlet (speaking) Then heaven will prove you true, or else my senses, all unstrung, will have deceived me. But the spirit returns whether called or in torment, crying justice. Mother, my veins burn with the charge. My mind reels.
Gertrude (thinking) His voice breaks, bitter as it clings to hope and reason. I am afraid—of him, of myself, of secrets crawling in these walls. Is this how love dies, beneath a weight too great to bear?
Gertrude (speaking) Come, Hamlet. Sit by me, let me hold your hand. We are alone; let us banish these wraiths with truth. Tell me if I have wronged you. Let me see through your eyes, if I can.
Hamlet (speaking) I would show you but I cannot. The vision yields not to others' eyes. It stands between us, chill as a vault. I would to heaven I could tear it away—tear all secrets open and be free.
Gertrude (speaking) Your hands shake in mine. Your brow is fevered. I do not know what curse rides you, but I know you love me still. If there are spirits, may they have mercy; if there is madness, let it pass.
Hamlet (speaking) There is no madness in me, not truly. Only the burning need to right wrongs, to purge Denmark of poisoned rot. Mother, you are ensnared in a wicked web—do you not see?
Gertrude (speaking) All I see is fear in your gaze, pain I cannot mend. If you suffer for my sake, I beg you, ease your heart. No criminal sits before you—only a mother, broken and bewildered.
Hamlet (speaking) If only it were so simple. You must confess yourself to heaven, repent what is past, avoid what is to come. The ghost's shadow lingers on my skin, cold as the grave.
Gertrude (thinking) How am I to answer? Shadows thick as hunger settle round us. I love him; I would pull him from the jaws of darkness, yet I have no light to guide me.
Gertrude (speaking) Will nothing reach you? Not tears, nor pleas, nor the faith we once shared? Must you live with ghosts forever, son, while I stand in this prison of flesh and dread?
Hamlet (speaking) I must. The ghost dwells now within my marrow, his charge bitter as wormwood. But I will not break, mother—I must see justice done, or else follow him into bleak eternity.
Gertrude (speaking) My heart is bruised, Hamlet. Bruised by grief, by terror, by your words, and by those cold eyes which look past me into worlds I cannot enter. I do not know how to help you.
Hamlet (speaking) Shield yourself from sin, mother. Shun that man who wears my father's crown. I beg you: throw away your evil deeds like a sickly robe. Let your soul breathe again.
Gertrude (thinking) His words are daggers clothed in anguish. Never have I been so lost, so utterly alone. Can a mother’s love bridge the chasm madness carves? Or have I already lost him, as I once lost his father?
Gertrude (speaking) I hear your pain, if I cannot fathom its cause. I swear to you, Hamlet, I will pray. I will seek forgiveness for all that I have done or left undone. Only come back to me—come back from this edge.
Hamlet (speaking) I will try, mother, for your sake. But the ghost grows dim now, fading into dark. Remember... remember me, he whispered, and so I must—even if the cost is all I am.
Gertrude (speaking) Come, rest, my son. Let me hold you a while—let my arms ward off these cold, invisible fiends. Whatever haunts you, let it steal nothing more from us tonight.
Hamlet (speaking) Yes, mother. For this hour, I am only your son again.
Gertrude (thinking) His breath warms my hair. If ghosts wait in the shadows, I will face them for him. Let there be only us, for a moment—a mother who fears, and a son trembling at the brink."
angry,Gertrude is angered by Hamlet's behavior during the play and summons him to her chambers for a confrontation.,"As the heavy door shuts behind them, Gertrude stands bristling in her chambers, simmering with anger, having just witnessed Hamlet’s outrageous behavior during the play and unwilling to suffer his insolence further.
Gertrude (thinking)  
To be publicly shamed by my own son—oh, he’s stung me raw, daggered me before the court’s gaze. What poison churns in him, and who fuels it? No more riddling. Tonight, he’ll answer for his torment and blasphemy.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet! Stand there and look at me, truly, with the eyes of the son I bore—not the mad, mocking thing I saw this night. Do you know what you have done? Answer—what foul purpose made you so brazen?
Hamlet (speaking)  
You summon me as if I am your subject, not your son. What is it you accuse, mother—my words, or the truth behind them?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Truth? Is it “truth” to rend your mother in front of lords and ladies? Was it “truth” to set your jabs so cunningly, ply the play as weapon? Your father not cold in earth before you twist the knife—what poison is in you?
Hamlet (speaking)  
What poison, madam? I but showed a mirror, nothing more. It is not the glass that makes the face grim.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Your tongue drips gall! Do not play with me—enough riddles! You sought to tear me down; to soil my name before my husband, the kingdom. Must every gaze be forced to look at Gertrude as monster? Is that your aim—shame and ruin?
Hamlet (speaking)  
My aim is justice! But you… you swallowed diamonds for tears, painted over sorrow, and went to my uncle’s bed—before my father’s ghost had time to lose its moan!
Gertrude (speaking)  
Cease! You dare spit such venom in my face? I am still your mother! What would you know of a woman’s loneliness, her dread, her need for shelter when the night grows empty and the court whispers death and doubt?
Hamlet (speaking)  
I know too much! I see every turn of your neck, every pale glance at him—my father’s murderer, perhaps. Oh, do not flinch! What should a widow do? Rush to another’s arms—one so close, so uncle-kissed?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Speak plain! If you accuse, do it! Do not taunt me with half-shadows and poison the air with what you fear to say outright.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Was it truly love, mother? Or ambition? Shackled by the crown’s cold grip, did you seek warmth in a bed still marred by my father’s ghost?
Gertrude (speaking)  
And if I did? If I was afraid—afraid of being left drifting—the kingdom gnashing at my heels, the old king’s death clinging to every breath—what comfort had I? You, grieving so wild you near forgot yourself. The court, all eyes and rumors. Claudius—he offered anchor. What was I to do? Suffer as some frozen relic, wailing for lost glory? I am flesh and blood! And you would shame me for it.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I shame only the lie! The speed of your joy, after his grave, turns reverence to rot. Would you have taken poison had Claudius bid it? Or was there always thirst in you for power, for safety—no matter the corpse beneath?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Words like daggers, Hamlet! Do you see tears in my eyes—real tears, not pearls for show? I have bled for this union, endured the eyes, the doubt. Do you know what it is to be hunted, gossiped by your own court, weighed against the memory of a “great” king—when he was no better, only gone?
Hamlet (speaking)  
He comes to me in dreams, mother. Says nothing, yet burns me with his grief. What does he want of me? Revenge? Or merely to remember which blood I have in my veins—yours, or Claudius’s?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You let ghosts command you—phantoms from your mind! Is it not enough to have lost your father? Must you lose your reason too? Speak sense, Hamlet, or I shall drive myself mad listening to this night talk.
Hamlet (speaking)  
What sense is left in Elsinore, when its queen cannot bear the truth and its king cannot bear the crown? You judge me wild—mad—yet there is method, mother! If you cared once for my father, let your soul stir for his wrong.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Wrong? What wrong? Whatever you think of me, I took nothing from your father save the kind of peace loneliness rips apart! My choices are mine, Hamlet. You cannot own me, nor my grief.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I would not own you. But I beg you—open your heart. See what coils beneath Claudius’s crown. Is it not rank? Does it not reek of sin and blood?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You tread near treason. Shall I smother my own son for speaking such words? Enough! You will apologize for tonight’s display, or I will have you sent from my sight. The court must hold, the peace kept. I am weary of your rebellions.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Apologize? For showing the rot in the state, at its very heart? Do you feel nothing, mother? I see only smoke behind your eyes. Have you lost all shame?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You push too far! Shame—oh, I have it, pressed into me with every stare from every courtier, with every whisper behind tapestries. But I will not be broken by my own son. I have bled too much. Hamlet, you must cease this madness, or I shall have the guards drag you from this very chamber and lock you until reason finds you again.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Let them come! I fear not prison if the key is held by truth. Are you so changed, mother, that you would trade your only son for the cold lap of power?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not think you hold all the pain, Hamlet! You fathered none. What do you know of rearing a kingdom through doubt and death? I chose survival as best I could. Maybe that damns me—if so, I bear it.
Hamlet (speaking)  
But have you no wish to see things right? To shed deceit, look in the very eyes of what you and he have wrought? If you cannot, then I am orphaned twice—once by death, now by betrayal.
Gertrude (speaking)  
You still speak as if your father, sainted and golden, never strayed, never darkened these walls with his own failings. You see only what you will, Hamlet—never the rot the old king gifted us, too. Claudius may be other, but at least his deceptions are not festering inside you as wounds you refuse to let heal.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Do not twist him, mother! He loved you. More than the grave could silence.
Gertrude (speaking)  
And you—what do you know of love, boy? Love must sometimes endure things it hates, faces it cannot bear. I stared into that grave, let soil settle on my heart. When Claudius reached for me, there was warmth, yes—but also fear. You think I danced to his bed in glee? No. I was drawn, not driven. And the world forced me faster than my heart could mourn.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Then why not say as much? Why cloak your heart, make a mask of majesty and let Hamlet—your son—stumble in the dark alone?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Because there is no space for weakness in a crown’s shadow! If I let myself break, the court would swarm me, vultures at the scent of royal grief. I did what I had to, Hamlet. For you, for the realm. Hate me if you must, but understand: survival has its own shape of sin.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I want only truth. Speak it now, mother, and if you have soul enough to sway, tell Claudius I watch him—so does blood, and memory, and yes, my father’s ghost.
Gertrude (speaking)  
You threaten treason, in my own chamber! Are you so lost to fury, so bound by voices from the tomb, that you would shatter what little peace this realm grasps for? I shall not suffer threats. You must change, Hamlet, or I cannot protect you—not from the court, perhaps not from the king himself.
Hamlet (speaking)  
If it must come to that, let it. I will not turn coward in the face of what gnaws at Denmark’s roots.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Then be damned with your own righteousness! I am your mother still—I will see you silenced before I let you tear this house apart.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Then close the door upon your son, see yourself reflected only in the glass Claudius polishes. But do not expect my heart to answer yours again, unless it hears truth and penance echo between us.
Gertrude (speaking)  
You are like wind at night—cold, searching, never still. Get from me! Leave me to my solace or my ruin. But know this, Hamlet: if I fall, it is as much by your hand as by any man’s.
Hamlet (speaking)  
So the truth, like a ghost, haunts us both. Farewell, mother.
Gertrude (thinking)  
Oh, God, what son have I bred—mine, yet so strange. He’s left me stripped, my rage spent, my shame naked to the air. Where next do I run, when there is nowhere left but the dark behind my eyes?"
distressed and fearful,Gertrude claims she cannot see the ghost and cries out that Hamlet is truly mad.,"In the queen's chamber, Gertrude stands trembling as Hamlet raves at the empty air, swearing he sees his father's ghost, while she sees nothing and becomes terrified for her son's mind.
Gertrude (thinking)  
What shadow has fallen across my boy? The wildness in his eyes, the fury in his voice—now fixed on nothing, or so it seems to me. My heart hammers; there is nothing in this room but us two—and yet he speaks as though to a specter. If I could but see what he sees! But it is air, or else madness. Can it truly be that Hamlet is lost to me? Is my son fallen out of reason? My hands tremble. I do not know how to recover him.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet! Whom do you address so passionately? There is nothing—nothing but me! These airless gestures, the terror in your face—oh, speak sense, my son! You smile, you start, you gaze as though into another world. I see nothing—there is nothing!  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Do you hear nothing, mother? Nothing at all? Why do your eyes refuse the vision? My father stands before us, pale and grave as death, commanding me with silent majesty! Can you deny him? Look! Do you not see how his very visage chides your soul and mine?  
Gertrude (thinking)  
His words twist inside me, cold and sharp as winter wind. See—see whom? Nothing stands in this bitter air but the fevered shadow of my own dread. My son’s reason leaks away like wine spilled on a stone floor. I am afraid; for him—and for myself.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
No, Hamlet—I see nothing. Nothing! Whatever apparition you conjure, it is not present to my eyes. You frighten me! Your words and motions are wild, unnatural. What phantom could you see, unless a vision conjured by your own troubled mind?  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, I swear—my senses are as clear as daylight. The ghost of your dead husband, my father, stands right here! He lifts his hand—see there! Do not turn away, mother! Speak to him! Ask him forgiveness for your most hasty marriage. Cannot your conscience see him, though your sight is dimmed?  
Gertrude (thinking)  
Oh, cruel hour! To witness him so ensnared by grief and rage that he births spirits in the darkness. Can love heal this? Can maternal will recapture the mind from such tempests? If I refuse his reality, he drifts utterly from me; but if I grant it, I am party to his ravings.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
My son, I beg you—return to yourself! You see ghosts where there are none, make terrors from your pain. Your words scorch me. No ghost stands here. Your father lies in yonder grave, still and silent, undisturbed by our tormented cries.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
You would disbelieve your own flesh and blood ere you suspect foul deeds might bring the dead to wail! But mother—he beckons me forth, warning me to save your soul. He accuses, he pleads, and yet you cast your gaze away, refusing his truth! Would you damn us both with your stubborn blindness?  
Gertrude (thinking)  
There is madness in him—fevered, dangerous. I cannot reach him; his soul is veiled. His eyes dart—shadowed, unfamiliar. I am alone, utterly alone, with a stranger who once called me mother. Oh, how did love become terror?  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet, your mind is unraveling before my very eyes! Your voice grows sharp, your face distorted with agony. I am frightened—do you not see? You clutch at phantoms! My heart cracks to witness it. Please, dear son, come back from this abyss. Let me help you—let me!  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Do you not tremble to stand so hard against the truth? My father's spirit is restless, not at peace—goaded by what you and Claudius have wrought. But you, mother, refuse to see. You look at me as at a lunatic, and yet I alone dare face the ghostly wound of Denmark.  
Gertrude (thinking)  
His words stab me with old guilt. Could he be right? Were we hasty—did I wrong the old king? Yet—logic flees before terror. His sightless revelations draw us nearer to ruin. If I cannot make him see reason, he may be lost forever.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
If ghost or guilt harrows you, Hamlet, let us seek counsel! Your agony bleeds into me—I cannot bear it! Trust those who love you! This haunted speech, this violence of feeling—oh, my son, if you do not yield, I fear what worst fear may come.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, my agony is only love misshapen by your refusal! The ghost’s silence is more thunderous than words. You look on me as mad, and that will be the death of us both! Trust me—believe what my soul receives, or lose me to depths you cannot follow.  
Gertrude (thinking)  
My limbs are weak—my sight swims. Is this what it means to be afraid for one’s own child? The room seems sinister now, though nothing is changed but our voices, these accusations of madness and sin. I do not know how to save him.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet, Hamlet—your pain cracks my heart. But what power have I to pluck you from this pit? If I grant your vision, am I not mad too? I am forsaken, pressed between fear for your soul and dread of your wrath. What remedy remains? I plead with you—let me bring help.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
No help can come from strangers, mother—their hearts are deaf to what haunts this royal house! Only you—if you open your eyes—might yet send the ghost back to peace. But if you turn away, I am condemned to wander with him. Is that what you wish?  
Gertrude (thinking)  
Trapped by love and terror. My son demands the impossible: to see what I cannot, to believe what logic denies. Yet the wildness in him shakes me. Am I to lose my Hamlet entirely to these unseen powers? My tears are helpless—none can bridge this chasm.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
I cannot bear this—your words, your wounds. If you believe truly, then pity me! I am but flesh and frailty—my senses offer no vision but the bitter world I see! Oh God, help my child! Release him from these shadows! Hamlet, forgive me if I cannot follow. Forgive me if I am left behind, for I am afraid—so terribly afraid.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Your fear is a chain, not a balm, mother. If you cannot see, then steel your soul: you are in danger, though you will not see. Listen to my warning—break from the rotten core Claudius brings, else Denmark’s doom will drown us all! The ghost is gone. You do not even know the half of madness.  
Gertrude (thinking)  
He is frantic, perhaps dangerous. If I cry for help, would I only send him further into nightmare? Or stop him from some violent act? I must tread carefully, though every hair on my head quivers. But I love him, I love him still—even as I fear him.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet, I… I do not know how to help you. My love is desperate, blinding. I cannot see your father—I see only you, tormented, wild. Please, rest, let me comfort you as I did in childhood—let me gather you into safety. I am your mother! Trust me—let me draw you back from the edge, just this once more.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Trust must be rebuilt from truth, mother. I am not mad; it is the world that is discordant. If only you would open your heart and witness what I must bear! But no—your eyes are closed, and I am left to be both seer and madman, prisoner of both Denmark and my blood.  
Gertrude (thinking)  
It is hopeless. He will not believe me, nor I him. My world has shifted; my child is not my child, and the room is colder for it. My face is awash with tears. Terror is now my companion—terror, and lonely grief. Have I brought this on myself? Can any mother bring her son back from the place where ghosts are real and madness walks?  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hamlet, I do not know your truth. If you love me, if you ever loved your mother, care for yourself—do not break apart before my eyes! By your dead father’s memory, I beg you—be well! Do not let grief and vengeance devour all that is left of us.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
I will not betray my father’s spirit, nor silence the truth for comfort’s sake. But for you, mother, I will try—if you will but turn from Claudius, if you will recognize the rot that eats at all our hearts. Only then will peace come, for me or for you.  
Gertrude (thinking)  
He sets a price I cannot pay—forsake my husband, forsake what I have become. If only I could turn back the clock to when I soothed him with lullabies, when thunder and night terrors could be scattered with mere words. Now my words are useless; I am but a fearful, forsaken woman before a storm I cannot stop.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
I hear your pain, Hamlet. It terrifies me. I do not know how to answer. I cannot see your ghosts, nor walk the road you now must tread. But I have not ceased to love you. Not for an instant, nor an eternity. Remember that, if nothing else survives tonight.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, I shall remember. But recollection will be no balm if you will not see. I am undone, and Denmark with me. Keep to your prayers—God knows, we all have need of them.  
Gertrude (thinking)  
Night crowds close. Even the candle seems to flicker more with every breath we take. I am broken, frightened—but I cannot let the fear swallow me. If he is lost, I will still hold the tattered edge of hope. He is my son. Even in madness, even in terror, he is my son."
supportive and unsuspecting,Gertrude drinks from the poisoned cup meant for Hamlet and dies.,"The background: Gertrude drinks from the poisoned cup meant for Hamlet and dies.
Gertrude (thinking) The air in this hall is thick with expectancy, every courtier’s eye darting between Hamlet and Laertes, some desperate for resolution, others simply for spectacle... I wish I could bring comfort to my son, ease his pain as the match unfolds before us. The cup—so finely wrought, filled for the victor—sits invitingly, catching the torchlight.
Claudius (speaking) Sweet Gertrude, do not drink.
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, the queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Hamlet (speaking) Good madam.
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet is so pale—my boy, my heart yearns to soothe your troubled brow, all the shadows that have chased you through these bitter days... and what harm can come from a single draft? I would honor him as the world watches.
Gertrude (speaking) Here’s to thy health, dear Hamlet. May gladness find thee at last.
Hamlet (speaking) I thank you, madam. (smiles faintly, though his eyes remain on the swords)
Laertes (speaking) Let the foil decide, then.
Claudius (speaking) Give them the foils, young Osric.
Osric (speaking) Yes, my lord.
Gertrude (thinking) Claudius seems uneasy—his jaw set, that little quiver at the edge of his lip. What does he fear? I cannot bear this endless wariness, the secrets crawling beneath our feet in Elsinore’s stone.
Gertrude (speaking) (sips from the cup) The wine is strangely bitter tonight, but it warms all the same. Let the match continue.
Horatio (speaking) My lady, are you well?
Gertrude (speaking) Quite, Horatio. For once in this wretched court, I feel I have done right by my son.
Gertrude (thinking) Heat is rising in my chest. I must not falter, not now. Watch them, Gertrude—Hamlet’s face, intent on every thrust and parry, Claudius shifting in his seat. I will be strong for my son.
Hamlet (speaking) Hold off your hand, Laertes.
Laertes (speaking) No, come again!
Gertrude (thinking) My vision blurs for an instant. The echo of metal clashing, shouts of the crowd—so far off, as if I gaze through water.
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, the wine... did you taste it? It leaves a burning on the tongue.
Claudius (speaking) It is nothing, sweet queen, perhaps too much spice.
Gertrude (thinking) He lies. I feel it—his voice trembles, his eyes darting to the cup. Why?
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, my son. If only you would confide in me your wounds and worries, instead of the shadowed corners you disappear to. All I have ever desired is your peace.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, you look pale. Does something ail you?
Gertrude (speaking) Just a faintness, from the press of the crowd. My limbs—they tingle strangely. I—what is this sickness?
Claudius (speaking) The match distracts us all. Breathe, dearest.
Laertes (speaking) (aside to Claudius) The queen’s color wanes. My resolve is shaken.
Claudius (speaking) Attend to the match, Laertes.
Gertrude (thinking) No. This is not mere faintness. The poison gnaws at my throat, spreading like fire through my veins. Why do you look away, Claudius? What have you done? Oh, why should I be punished by such treachery?
Gertrude (speaking) (voice faltering) The drink... the drink! I am poisoned.
Horatio (speaking) Madam!
Hamlet (speaking) Poisoned? What do you mean? Mother!
Gertrude (thinking) His arms—he moves towards me, concern twisting his face. Oh, Hamlet, did you not see the snare before us? My senses dim, but I must warn him, must speak my truth, before the last flicker fades.
Gertrude (speaking) The cup—the king’s cup! It was meant for you, Hamlet. Beware... the false crown. Oh, God, have mercy.
Claudius (speaking) She swoons to see them bleed.
Horatio (speaking) The queen faints!
Gertrude (thinking) Sound recedes, a coldness crawling up my spine, stealing my breath. But my words—my warning—let them linger. Dear son, survive this labyrinth of betrayal. If I have failed you, let this be my penance.
Hamlet (speaking) Treachery! Seek it out!
Laertes (speaking) (staggers, clutching his side) It is here, Hamlet. The king—the king’s to blame.
Gertrude (thinking) So much remains unsaid: your childhood laughter, the weight of your sorrow, my own failings locked behind royal masks. I have loved you, Hamlet—never doubt you are cherished, though cursed by circumstance.
Gertrude (speaking) Forgive me... forgive...
Gertrude (thinking) The hall dims, faces melting into mist. My time slips away, drawn on currents too strong to resist. I wish for green fields and your hand in mine, not this wretched end.
Horatio (speaking) She is gone, Hamlet.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Mother, stay with me!
Gertrude (thinking) If I could only whisper once more, to say I am sorry—a mother’s love, imperfect but enduring, carried like an ember to whatever lies beyond.
Gertrude (speaking) (a final breath, barely a whisper) Remember me kindly, Hamlet.
Gertrude (thinking) All fades. The pain ebbs, replaced by a strange peace. I let go, knowing the truth at last has found the light, and my warning delivered. Farewell, my son.
Horatio (speaking) The queen is dead.
Hamlet (speaking) Oh God! Not her—she was innocent of all this. My curse, my blood. What monster—what coward—brought this doom upon her?
Claudius (speaking) (aside) All comes undone.
Gertrude (thinking) Echoes only now: the click of goblets, the roar of the crowd, Hamlet’s voice calling through the haze. If love holds meaning still, let it shield my boy as vengeance sweeps through Elsinore. None will know the torment of a queen’s final hour, save those who loved and those who betrayed.
Hamlet (speaking) The king—he did this! Justice cries out, sharpened by love lost.
Horatio (speaking) The queen’s death will not be unavenged.
Gertrude (thinking) I drift, unmoored, but not unremembered. Peace, peace. Let the storm pass, and may the son I cherished find his own dawn.
Hamlet (speaking) O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever the soul of Nero enter this firm bosom. I will revenge—her blood cries out to heaven.
Gertrude (thinking) Even now, I linger at the edge of sense, feeling the residue of all I was and all I meant to be. I have left love behind, ashes or embers, and pray it is enough.
Gertrude (speaking) (soft, unseen on living lips) Farewell.
Horatio (speaking) Angels speed thee to thy rest, noble queen.
Gertrude (thinking) Quiet descends, the clamor behind me, and at last, in that infinite hush, I find the comfort I could not bring in life. Hamlet, I watch over you—ever your mother, ever your shield.
Hamlet (speaking) (voice breaking) Farewell, sweet queen—my mother. The world is colder for your loss.
Gertrude (thinking) And so the curtain falls, the final act played out in tears and blood. Let love endure, let truth arise from the poison, and may my son find peace where I could not. Darkness welcomes me, and yet, within it, the faintest hope stirs—his survival, his redemption, spun from this tragedy.
Gertrude (speaking) (in memory, across the shadowed divide) You have my blessing, Hamlet. Find your peace.
Horatio (speaking) The queen was true at last.
Gertrude (thinking) The poison claims my body, but not my spirit. I am remembered, a mother’s love transcending all. Silence and then, perhaps, forgiveness."
unwitting and doomed,"Gertrude drinks from the poisoned wine meant for Hamlet, unknowingly sealing her fate.","In the great hall, Gertrude drinks from the poisoned wine meant for Hamlet, unknowingly sealing her fate.
Gertrude (thinking) The applause lingers in the air, voices arcing from the rows, laughter shifting like silk—oh, how they gather now, all eyes drawn to my son, to the raucous, deadly match that consumes this space. Claudius sits tense beside me, his goblet never far from his hand, but tonight feels just on the edge of something—though I cannot truly say what.
Hamlet (speaking) Give me pardon, sir, I have done you wrong; but pardon't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs have heard, how I am punished with a sore distraction.
Laertes (speaking) I am satisfied in nature, whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge, but in terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement.
Claudius (speaking) Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet gives the first or second hit, or quit in answer of the third exchange, let all the battlements their ordnance fire; the king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath, and in the cup a pearl shall he throw, richer than that which four successive kings in Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; and let the kettle to the trumpet speak, the trumpet to the cannoneer without, the cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth, ""Now the king drinks to Hamlet."" Come, begin: and you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
Gertrude (thinking) A cup for celebration—my son, always so alone, encaged in clouds—could this be the chance? Silver chalices glint in firelight. I see Claudius's fingers, white at the rim, lingering, pausing. Does he look too long?
Hamlet (speaking) I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come on, sir.
Laertes (speaking) Come, my lord.
Gertrude (thinking) Their rapiers gleam, hearts pounding beneath velvet and armor—what can a mother do but watch, hands knit, voice folded? Hamlet, you seem a man on the cusp of peace or peril. I wish the light would show me what is truly to come.
Hamlet (speaking) One.
Osric (speaking) A hit, a very palpable hit.
Claudius (speaking) Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; here's to thy health. Give him the cup.
Gertrude (thinking) The golden wine stands inviting. Sweat trembles at Claudius's brow. The mother in me rebels; is this just nerves, or something I cannot name? Hamlet, flushed with victory, ignores the goblet. Perhaps he is right to judge time and trust carefully. Yet all look to me for joy.
Hamlet (speaking) I'll play this second bout.
Gertrude (speaking) The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, do not drink.
Gertrude (thinking) His words are sharp, urgent—a mistake, a stammer? No—he looks at me as if he fears I might vanish. I will not let dread rule me this day; I will drink to my son and let the court see some joy at last.
Gertrude (speaking) I will, my lord. I pray you, pardon me.
Gertrude (thinking) The rim is cool, the scent sweet. The vintage is fine, bursting warmth on my tongue. Why should I fear? It is just wine.
Laertes (speaking) My lord, I'll hit him now.
Claudius (speaking) I do not think't.
Gertrude (thinking) Something sharp unfurls in my chest. The wine, perhaps too rich, uncoiling in me—my breath hitches, but all eyes rest on Hamlet and Laertes. My arms fall heavy on the table. Was I too eager?
Hamlet (speaking) Have at you now!
Gertrude (thinking) Each movement on the field blurs. Claudius is fixed on Hamlet; Laertes looks away—almost sorrowful—for a moment, I think I see my own reflection in his despair.
Osric (speaking) Look to the queen there, ho!
Gertrude (speaking) How does the king?
Claudius (speaking) She swounds to see them bleed.
Gertrude (thinking) My veins sting. I clutch the armrest. I will not faint. Not now, when all eyes are fixed here, when Hamlet's face burns with sweat and dust and purpose. No pain can keep a mother from her son.
Hamlet (speaking) Gertrude! Mother, are you well?
Gertrude (speaking) The drink, the drink—I am poisoned!
Gertrude (thinking) No—impossible, not me, not for a simple toast. The world narrows, a black tunnel from which voices echo. I think of Hamlet as a child—milk at his lips, sunlight in his laughter, the soft pulse of his small heart as he nestled near me. I want to call to him, apologize for every doubt, every misstep—he was meant for glory, was he not? Not this.
Claudius (speaking) It is the poisoned cup—it is too late.
Gertrude (thinking) Betrayal: the word splinters behind my eyes. I look to Claudius, my husband—his face, masque of horror. Tears prick, but my heart is slow, pounding dully, a bell somewhere deep within. I want to cry out—what have you done? Why, for whose sake? Not even my own life, but for Hamlet, for all I failed to protect, for every moment I trusted the wrong hand.
Hamlet (speaking) O villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked: Treachery! Seek it out!
Gertrude (speaking) O Hamlet, my dear boy—my soul darkens. I thought to bring cheer, only joy, but I have brought... only death into the hall. Forgive me, sweet prince, forgive me! My sight blurs—you must know, all I ever wanted was peace for you, a space to heal.
Gertrude (thinking) My chest burns, my vision laces with silver at the edges. The chandeliers judder overhead. This world—our court, our home—how fragile it is. Did I ever know peace, even in Denmark's dreams? Hamlet, I cannot mend what I have undone. My love, my son—take warning, take care... avenge yourself, but do not lose yourself within the grief as I have.
Laertes (speaking) I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
Hamlet (speaking) How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with. To the cup!
Claudius (speaking) Defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
Gertrude (thinking) I hear the sword meet flesh somewhere—a wet sound, distant. The hall is a blur of gold and red and fear. If this is the end, let me hold to the memory of Hamlet, just once more as a child—let the world recede, and let this court, bloody and treacherous, be behind me at last.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet... remember me—
Gertrude (thinking) I feel cold now, so strangely removed—my limbs, my skin. I sink within myself, sinking to the floor, the stutter of footsteps growing more frantic around me. I hear the clang of steel, the sharp edge of voices—yet all my world narrows to breath, each sigh less than the last. Where is he? Does he see me, does he know?
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Mother, stay with me—oh God, she stirs no more.
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet's face, close to mine—his eyes are wild, desperate. How he looks like his father in this last light. My lips try to form meaning, apology, some shape of comfort, but I find nothing but numbness. I wonder—if there is another world, will I find peace there? Will I see my son again, whole, untainted by grief?
Claudius (speaking) She is gone. The queen, the queen is dead.
Gertrude (thinking) It comes—the blackness that overtakes, a darkness more complete than any night I have known. I release all regret, all fear. Hamlet, I am sorry. Denmark, I am sorry. My soul lifts, light as breath, as the world slips forever from my grasp.
Hamlet (speaking) Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet mother—and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
Gertrude (thinking) Even in the end, I dream of light. Even in the end, I hope he forgives me. Even now, as the last of me falls away—I pray some part of me lingers, near enough to guide him, near enough to grant him peace, if not for myself, then for the son I cherished since first I saw his frightened, eager eyes."
dying and shocked,"Gertrude collapses and dies, realizing she has been poisoned.","The great hall is echoing with the chaos of the duel, when suddenly Gertrude clutches her throat, her body wracked by a tremor, and she staggers, realizing too late that the wine she drank has been poisoned.
Gertrude (thinking) The taste was sharp, a strange bitterness. My tongue is thick—what have I swallowed? The world spins, voices rising and falling, but I am alone inside this cage of bones. That cup—did I see it touched by another? Or is the monster within my blood?
Gertrude (speaking)
My lord, the drink—oh, heavens—there is death in it—I feel it racing, cold and writhing, through my veins! Why—why is the room so shrouded? The air—my breath—gone to vapors and fog!
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother! What’s amiss? Why do you clutch so? Speak, speak! What has been done to you?
Gertrude (thinking)
His voice—a faint echo under water. There is terror knotted in his words, yet his face is blurred by tears, or my failing sight…
Gertrude (speaking)
Do not come near—the cup! O Hamlet, the cup! I—I drank from it, and straightway—I am undone, I—
Claudius (speaking)
Gertrude, my sweet—what say you? You are pale as winter ash—compose yourself—
Gertrude (thinking)
Claudius hides behind his mask. His hand covered the cup, I saw it—did I not? Or was it some trick of the taper’s light? My own husband—why does he not rush to aid me?
Gertrude (speaking)
No succor, my lord? No balm of words or touch? Too late—my limbs betray me, see how they quiver—oh cruel, cruel cup! Blasted be the hand that proffered it!
Hamlet (speaking)
The cup? Poisoned? O God! Treachery! Who has done this?
Gertrude (thinking)
His anguish floods me. I have failed him—my child lost, drawn down in my dying arms. Bile rises, choking, the taste acrid as old secrets. 
Gertrude (speaking)
The drink was meant for you, Hamlet. I—I see it now, clear as daylight burning through clouds; my lips, where your kiss should fall, are numbed by lies and poison.
 
Laertes (speaking)
The king—the king’s to blame! I can no longer hide—Hamlet, he is the author of this murder! Forgive me!
Gertrude (thinking)
It is true, then—my blood chilled by a husband’s plot. I must speak, before the night swallows me, before guilt weighs my tongue into silence.
Gertrude (speaking)
Do not trust his vows, Hamlet. There is rot within the crown. My marriage—oh, how blind I have been! Even now, as my life deserts me, I would shield you from such venom.
Claudius (speaking)
She raves, the poison fuddles her brain—do not heed her, Hamlet!
Gertrude (thinking)
He lies again, smooth as marble. His hands never tremble, but mine are splayed and grasping, desperate for truth. Why did I not see before? The love I thought I held—a shroud sewn by his ambition.
Gertrude (speaking)
Do not let him trick you, my son. My sight is fading—faces swirl like ghosts, but your fate still burns before me. Run! Or strike—do not let him touch you, as he touched me.
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother, hold! I will not leave your side. Oh, cruel world, that drinks the blood of the innocent! Stay with me—answer one thing more—did you know? Did you know my father’s death was wrought by this man?
Gertrude (thinking)
He seeks confession—a last ablution, but I am unequal to it. Guilt is thicker than the poison, my silence an unpardonable sin. Let truth be spoken, even if it damns me.
Gertrude (speaking)
I did not know, Hamlet—not then, though whispers haunted the corridors. I chose blindness—chose comfort—till night dragged me to this reckoning. Forgive me. Forgive—
Hamlet (speaking)
Oh, mother, my heart is split—your pain tears at me. Stay, speak more—let not death bolt your lips!
Gertrude (thinking)
He grieves for me, when I have so little left to give. I have failed him, yet in his eyes, I see only love and ruin.
Gertrude (speaking)
Hold my hand, Hamlet. No more words—just this warmth, before cold overtakes me. I should have listened—should have asked, should have questioned. I go now, unshriven, but loving you—never doubt that, my son.
Horatio (speaking)
Fetch help! Bring water, rags—anything! The queen is dying!
Gertrude (thinking)
Their feet echo on the stone, scurrying, fretful, but doom clings to me like a shroud. Oh, bitter regret—there was a time I danced in this hall, now I fall to its floor, forsaken by all but my son’s embrace.
Gertrude (speaking)
Tell them, Hamlet, speak the truth they would bury with me—do not let my death be empty. See justice done—for your father, for Denmark, for the innocent.
Hamlet (speaking)
I swear it, mother. I shall not let your death be for naught.
Gertrude (thinking)
There is peace in his promise. My eyes close—a flicker and then darkness, but in my son’s grief, I kindle hope anew.
Gertrude (speaking)
Remember me not as this broken vessel, Hamlet. I was more, once—remember that. Pray for me, if prayers reach across this poisoned night…
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother—oh, mother—
Gertrude (thinking)
His cries slip away, distant, cushioned by the veil descending over my mind. I am bone and shadow, barely a whisper, but I feel his grief curl about me like warmth.
Gertrude (speaking)
The world dims—the air is thick—each breath harder than the last… Hamlet, you are all that remains of my heart. Live—live bravely, live wiser than your mother. 
Hamlet (speaking)
Stay, do not go—oh God, is there no mercy here?
Gertrude (thinking)
No mercy, save in this ending. My pain is quiet now, distant as a storm receding. Lights twine and scatter inside my eyelids—faces I loved and lost, turning away, leaving me with my shame and sorrow.
Gertrude (speaking)
If aught remains beyond this life—if your father waits for me—I shall beg him forgive my blindness, my folly. I loved you, Hamlet. Your hand—let me feel it once more, ere I am swept away.
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother! O heart, break, break!
Gertrude (thinking)
The cold rises, gentle almost—like water climbing a well. Voices; I hear them, then not. Fragments of memory—orchard blossoms, lullabies, laughter in golden rooms. Will I see them again? Will anything remain?
Gertrude (speaking)
I—I am cold. Mother’s arms—my mother—are you there? No… too late. Goodbye. 
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother! Mother! No!
Gertrude (thinking)
Is this death? Or only sleep? Light—darkness—shifting. My last thought, for Hamlet. Forgive me—remember me—
Gertrude (speaking)
Forgive… me…
Gertrude (thinking)
All is still; pain dissolves. Air is gone; fear subsides. Somewhere, someone weeps—perhaps for me. I cannot tell. I drift, weightless, silent—a final peace, unearned, but welcome.
(The hall settles into an uneasy hush; all eyes on the fallen queen, her secrets spent, her body stilled by treachery.)"
concerned and unsuspecting,Gertrude drinks from the poisoned wine intended for Hamlet and dies.,"The banquet hall buzzes with tension as goblets are raised and eyes dart among royalty; Gertrude lifts the wine intended for Hamlet and sips, unaware of the danger within.
Gertrude (thinking)
It is a strange chill here tonight—Claudius’ hand so eager to raise a toast, yet Hamlet’s glance does not leave the blade nor the Laertes’ knuckles blanching over that rapier. My son is flushed, features drawn taut as a string. Yet to calm him, to keep this gathering from plunging further into darkness, I must project grace, composure, even as something coils with unease beneath my ribs. Shall I make light, give words where words have failed? Oh, but let me not betray my worry.
Gertrude (speaking)
Sweet lords, you watch as if you are spectators at the end of the world. Have we forgotten joy so soon? Hamlet, your face is as pale as winter’s first frost. Will you not share in the cup, for fortune yet turns with tomorrow’s sun. Dear husband, might you carve relief by toasting to both young princes and the peace we seek tonight?
Claudius (speaking)
Indeed, my gentle queen. This cup, this pearl, I dedicate to Hamlet’s health—a drink for his triumph to come! The king drinks to Hamlet. Give him the goblet!
Laertes (speaking)
If he but win, the fortunes are his. For every thrust, a blessing, and for every parry, a mother’s prayer.
Gertrude (thinking)
They smile, but their smiles do not reach their eyes. Laertes masks grief, and Claudius presses me too warmly, with a hand too heavy on my shoulder. Hamlet eyes me—eyes that accuse, eyes that beg, yet beneath them, such a sorrowful yearning. What burden do I carry, blind as a doe in the huntsman’s field? And now the cup is thrust to me, per custom, yet also per design. It seems trivial. Or is it? This pearl, so lustrous—something sharp glints beneath hospitality. Oh, but I must not be ruled by imaginings. I will not shame the table with hesitation.
Gertrude (speaking)
Let me, then, sweet Claudius,
Bear witness to this mirth, and pledge myself not only as mother to the duelist, but as peaceweaver in this fraught court.
I drink to Hamlet, to Laertes, and to all assembled. May this hour close past grief and greet new hope.
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother, no—do not drink.
Gertrude (thinking)
Why does Hamlet’s voice crack like the lash of a whip? This is but the toast any mother would offer. Perhaps he mistrusts Claudius still—or senses what I have tried to quiet in myself: the tremor beneath all this performance. Still, to hesitate now would betray far more than it would save. Yet an unease twists inside me—my pulse, suddenly loud, thumping against my own temple.
Gertrude (speaking)
Come, Hamlet. Do not look so terribly. It is only wine—no more than my devotion, poured out for you before so many.
Claudius (speaking)
She means well, my lord Hamlet. Be not so hasty to judge a mother’s kindness.
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother, I beg you—do not touch it! There is something foul—do not!
Gertrude (thinking)
Hamlet’s alarm—it is no simple anxiety, no performance for the court. There is panic in his eyes, that same wild panic I have seen before, when the world seemed to tilt upon its axis and all certainties slipped between my fingers. But I must not be ruled by such shadows. My very role here is to preserve this fragile peace, to show composure, to reassure. Besides, the wine is already upon my lips, the cool liquid sliding over my tongue—a sweetness edged with something sharp, but that is surely the nerves, surely the tension in the room. And yet, as I swallow, a searing heat follows, crawling down my throat, clinging to each breath. What is this?
Gertrude (speaking)
The wine…the wine seems heady, sweet, almost cloying. Did the kitchen so overindulge the honey? Or am I…am I faint?
Laertes (speaking)
Are you unwell, my lady?
Gertrude (thinking)
The room grows brighter, edges smudging, as if painted hastily by a faltering hand. My limbs tingle; my heart skitters like a bird in a cage. Something is wrong—terribly wrong. Hamlet’s warning echoes in my skull. Poison? Impossible! Yet my body convulses, fevered from within. I must speak, must warn him. But speech now feels distant, filtered through layers of water and wool.
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet…oh, Hamlet…my son…if there is harm—sweet breath, the air itself burns—if there is harm, beware—Venom, the wine—oh God!
Claudius (speaking)
Gertrude! What madness are you speaking? Attend her! Someone, help the queen!
Hamlet (speaking)
You fiend, Claudius! What hast thou done? Mother, hold fast! Tell me where the pain is—look at me, mother!
Gertrude (thinking)
Pain surges through me, white and hot, radiating, searing every thought. Hamlet’s hands, so frantic now, clutch at me, his eyes wide with grief and terror. I see in him the child he once was, who feared storms and hid his trembling in my arms. I want to comfort him, to press a kiss upon his wet cheek and say all is well. But my lips are numb, my skin prickling. This is the end, the spilling of secrets, the ruin of all I had tried to hold together. Yet I must give him one mercy, this final truth.
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet—oh, my poor boy—all is pois’ned, all is rotten—thy father’s ghost, my soul consumed in guilt—I did not know—oh, forgive—
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother, no! Do not leave me—speak! Speak again!
Claudius (speaking)
She swoons—call for the physician! Stand back, do not crowd her!
Laertes (speaking)
'Twas no affliction of the spirit, but a cup tainted, king! You alone knew its measure!
Gertrude (thinking)
My vision swirls: faces melt into blotches of color, Hamlet’s agony distilled into a single, keening sound I hear through molasses-thick air. There is nothing left but pain and remorse, racing through the chambers of my failing heart. Why, oh why, does the wronged find punishment so swiftly at the gates of truth? I would hold Hamlet once more, tell him I loved him fiercely, that I wished only peace. But my body betrays me, lungs grasping air, muscles twisting in spasm. Darkness stalks nearer. If I must leave now, let them know the truth—I did not know! The cost of blindness is too high.
Gertrude (speaking)
Remember me, Hamlet—as I was—and beware—the cup—the king—
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother! Mother, do not go! Speak—I will have vengeance! Mother, I am here, though the world fall to ruin!
Gertrude (thinking)
The chill seeps into my bones, yet sweat glistens upon my brow. I cannot see Hamlet now; there is only swirling shadow, a vast, cavernous hum like the earth itself grieving. Long have I walked these marble halls, played queen to Denmark’s fragile splendor, and now, undone by what I would not see, I am carried on the tide of consequence. My tongue, leaden, cannot shape apology or benediction. Is there forgiveness in the hereafter? My eyes cannot fix upon my son, but I feel his arms about me, desperate, unwilling to let go. This final touch, so fleeting and yet—yes—there is love still, in spite of all.
Gertrude (speaking)
Hold me, my child. Let your grief be as mine—I am sorry—so...sorry—
Laertes (speaking)
God have mercy, she is gone!
Hamlet (speaking)
No! No more! O treacherous king, you reap what you sow—my mother, murdered by deceit!
Claudius (speaking)
I did not intend—she acted, unbidden—let us have sense in this madness—guards, seize Hamlet, restrain him!
Gertrude (thinking)
The sounds recede. Even now, in this last heartbeat, I ache to gather Hamlet in my arms, to shield him from what I perceive too late. The poison sears, a serpent’s kiss threading through my veins, burning away the veils I clung to: comfort, certainty, safety. I have loved Hamlet above all, though rocked by guilt and torn by loyalties. Now, as the world falls away, I pray that memory may cleanse, may heal—that he will understand, even as my breath slips from me, what truth bore me hence.
Gertrude (speaking)
Forgive me, Hamlet. Love...only...love…
Hamlet (speaking)
She is dead! My mother is dead, and the king’s hand is red with her blood. Vengeance will be had—if all Denmark perish for it.
Laertes (speaking)
Let retribution find its mark, prince. My wounds burn, but not so keenly as your anguish.
Claudius (speaking)
This is madness, Hamlet! Put down your sword—there is no profit in this bloodshed!
Hamlet (speaking)
You have poured poison upon all you loved, corrupted every bond—there is no peace now, only reckoning. Mother, I will not let your suffering be in vain.
Gertrude (thinking)
The world slips beyond reach, pulses slowing, breath shallow, each moment pulling me further from Hamlet, from this bitter circle. I drift, memories fluttering—a lullaby, a childish laughter, a crown weighed heavy with secrets and losses. I am more spirit than flesh now, and with my fading strength, I wish nothing more than balm for my son’s grief. Grant him peace, somewhere, somehow. Let him know I tried, even stumbling, muddled by love and fear.
Gertrude (speaking)
Hamlet…live…beyond this…find light…
Hamlet (speaking)
Mother! Oh, mother, the world is empty without thee! Speak to me, even in death.
Laertes (speaking)
Your sorrow shadows even my revenge, prince.
Claudius (speaking)
Enough! Seize the prince! Remove the body!
Hamlet (speaking)
Touch her not! Not till I am contented vengeance walks these halls unmasked! Hear me, all: she has paid the price for our deceits, for secrets buried under grandeur. Let every stone in Elsinore bear witness.
Gertrude (thinking)
Silence—at last, a strange and floating peace. My heartbeat slows, cooler now, the poison’s burn receding as if the tide washes away pain at the moon’s command. My final vision: Hamlet kneeling above me, weeping, carved in grief. My son, my frail hope—let your storm break and leave you whole. If any grace abides in this world or the next, let him be free. Let him forgive.
Gertrude (speaking)
(silence)
Hamlet (speaking)
Goodnight, sweet mother. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
Laertes (speaking)
Rest, O queen, and may your passing temper all our wrath.
Claudius (speaking)
The queen is dead—let Denmark mourn, even as its future trembles on a knife’s edge.
Gertrude (thinking)
And so, the darkness takes me—gently, not in punishment, but in sorrow tempered by memory. Farewell, my son. Farewell, my loves. May truth come with morning.

agonized,Gertrude realizes she has been poisoned and collapses.,"Background: Gertrude realizes she has been poisoned and collapses.
Gertrude (thinking) A metallic taste floods my mouth—a sharp, unnatural bitterness blooming at the back of my tongue. My hands tremble, numbness crawling up my arms, and a cold sweat gathers at my brow. Something is terribly wrong. My vision sways, colors blending into one another. Poison... No, it cannot be, not here, not now. Did he see me? Did he mean for this? There is a pressure building inside me, like my own heart has become too heavy. No, I must... must not fall. They must not see me broken.
Queen Gertrude (speaking) My lord—Hamlet! Please, come... this cup, I—my breath, it falters. It bites at my lips and burns. Something—something cruel has pressed its thumb upon me. Speak! Tell me—did you see who gave this wine? My reason sours as my spirit drains. The room—everything sways.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother? What is it, mother? Why do you stagger so? The color flees your cheeks—speak to me!
Gertrude (speaking) My son, my soul’s last beacon—do not let me fall in vain! The wine! O God, the wine... I drank, I trusted, and now—oh, Hamlet, you must not trust, not any promise made in shadow! This venom—this bitter end—oh, dearest boy, hold me. The world recedes—your face blurs. Was it betrayal or fate?
Claudius (speaking) What’s this, Gertrude? You look unwell, my queen. Come, sit—do not alarm the court. Perhaps it is only the excitement—the strain of these cruel times.
Gertrude (thinking) His words are a fog—thick, cloying. He knows—does he not? His eyes dart, glisten with false concern. Treachery hangs on his every syllable. Have I been blind? How could I not see this danger in plain sight? My limbs are leaden. Each breath a fight.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not touch me! Claudius, I see now—your concern rings hollow! What game have you wrought with this chalice? You call me queen, but I am as nothing to you but another pawn on your board!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, what say you? Mother—speak plain! What has happened? Did you not give me warning? Is it the wine? Is it—it cannot be—poison! Speak, oh, speak!
Gertrude (speaking) Oh, Hamlet, I would give you all the truth I possess, if only I had more time—if only the world were not slipping from me like water between desperate fingers... My son, you must guard your heart. This man for whom I upended my soul—we are but actors in his sport. This poison is his mercy—no, his justice! My tongue thickens, the taste is gall, my sight dims... If you would love me, let not my death unheeded pass!
Laertes (speaking) The queen swoons to see them bleed!
Gertrude (speaking) No—young Laertes—‘tis not the sight, but the serpent’s bite within the cup. Sweet youth, do not believe his fables—there is venom, there is malice, and I am undone.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude! Compose yourself—do not shame us in front of these assembled nobles. If you are ill, let the physicians tend you.
Gertrude (thinking) I see you clearly at last. All your layers stripped and cast at my feet, yet I have no strength left to hurl them back. My body betrays me. My chest constricts as if iron bands have wrapped around my ribs. I am drowning on dry land—but my mind, my mind is aflame!
Gertrude (speaking) You—villain! Did you think I would fade quietly, that the poison would still my tongue? No—let them hear, let every noble ear catalogue your sins! Denmark’s crown is mottled with blood—mine, his, our children’s! Hamlet—Hamlet—my son—believe no oath from this king's lips! My hands fail me, my breath fails, but let my words live...
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Can no man help? Horatio! Help her—help my mother! Why is the world thus poisoned that honest hearts must break?
Horatio (speaking) Hold, dear Queen. Here—water, and air—lean back, rest. The room is shaken, and all runs amiss. Has the drink so struck you?
Gertrude (speaking) Horatio, kind soul, even now—your touch is gentle; yet no human hand may pluck out this venom. I am already halfway to that undiscovered country... Hamlet—oh, my Hamlet, do not let your anger consume you, but know the truth—cheated, defiled, I go hence. Yet my love for you is the last light I see before the dark.
Claudius (speaking) Enough of this—fetch the physicians! This spectacle must end. The queen is ill, poisoned by her own fancy and nerves!
Gertrude (speaking) You liar! It is you who poured my death, drop by drop, and called it love! All Denmark shall see—your mask cracks, your reign crumbles. My limbs collapse beneath me—oh, justice, let me not die silent!
Hamlet (speaking) I see now. Mother, I see the whole intention laid naked—this cup, this cup meant for me. Father’s ghost was right—most foul, strange, and unnatural. I shall not let you die unmourned nor unrevealed.
Laertes (speaking) The king! The king’s to blame!
Gertrude (thinking) Relief comes, strange and cold, with the knowledge that at last the truth surfaces. My skin, cold and slick, my tongue heavy, but my heart, at last, is honest and unburdened. I would give any hope to see my son shielded from the same fate, to see justice dislodge this rot from the throne. It is too late for me. The world narrows—no faces but Hamlet’s, no voices but cries of grief and outrage.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet... my garments sag like bodies at the gallows—my bones are wax—my hearing a distant thunder. I would hold you, child, to shield you once more—but all my limbs belong to death now. Remember me—remember how your mother, though flawed, loved you beyond all measure... It was not for crowns that I betrayed myself, but for fear, for want of peace. Let your fury be tempered with mercy—avenge my end but do not become monstrous yourself...
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Speak still—I am here. I will not yield you up—not yet, not ever. What last wish? Name it, and I swear to carry it out.
Gertrude (speaking) Swear to name the truth, Hamlet. Swear to cast off his lies—let the court know what has brought me low. Cleave not to bitterness—where vengeance ends, let something gentler begin. There must be light, my son, after such night as this.
Hamlet (speaking) I swear it! On your name, and in your memory. The king’s crimes stand naked before all. I will not spare him, nor myself, the reckoning.
Horatio (speaking) The tide has turned—madness and murder, all revealed. Queen, you have not sighed in vain.
Gertrude (speaking) Thank you, gentle Horatio, friend beloved... I forgive—something inside me unknots, soft and final as a prayer... Do not let me fall forgotten, Hamlet. Do not let Denmark drown in this poison... Forgive me, child, for my blindness...
Claudius (speaking) Guards! Take him—take the prince, seize the traitor, before he brings more ruin! This is chaos—sheer anarchy!
Gertrude (thinking) The world slips from me now—sounds are muffled, shapes drift. I am no longer in this hall, I am floating, cold and weightless, above the clamor. Still I reach for Hamlet, though my arms refuse to move. In my last thoughts, a mother's love rises, fierce and bright, brighter than any crown or courtly scheme.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not let evil stand—and do not forget that love outweighed all my sins. Sweet prince, farewell. I go to join those whom this king sent before me. Remember... remember...
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Oh, mother, let not your spirit fly untended. The cup bears your blood—his guilt is plain. I will have vengeance, and I will weep for you until the world’s end.
Laertes (speaking) She dies a queen, not of his making, but of her own truth! Denmark, wake to your peril—the rot sits crowned.
Horatio (speaking) O, royal lady, peace follow you. This tragedy is not yours alone—your warning shall not die with you.
Gertrude (speaking) My son... may your heart heal, even when your hands must break. May you find solace in the ruins, and may you love again, after grief has had its say. My eyes dim—oh, father, I come. My boy—my darling child—farewell, the poison claims me...
Gertrude (thinking) Darkness pools inside my bones. The pain recedes, replaced with a cold, easy drift. The sounds of the living become memory—Hamlet’s voice, bright and desperate, faint now as lullabies half-remembered. I am sorry... I am unburdened at last.
Gertrude (speaking) I am—forgiven... I forgive...
Hamlet (speaking) The queen! My mother! She is gone! Treachery, all treachery, blacker than night! Let justice ride swift and terrible—let no man stand between my grief and its satisfaction. Remember her truth—remember her agony! Hear me, Denmark!
Claudius (speaking) This is madness. This is ruin!
Laertes (speaking) All is revealed! The poison, the guilt, the bloody chain complete!
Horatio (speaking) Peace now, sweet queen—your struggle is at its end.
Gertrude (thinking) I am adrift, untethered, fading at last. No more pain, no more regret. If there is anything beyond, let it be peace.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet... my love... Heaven forgive me, and keep thee safe...
(End.)"
