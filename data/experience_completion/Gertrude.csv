Gertrude (speaking)  
Enough of this venom! Your tongue wounds deeper than any traitor's blade, and you shame the memory of your noble father.
Hamlet (speaking)  
It is you who shames him with your hasty bed and painted smiles! How could you let Claudius touch the throne—and you—so soon after my father’s corpse grew cold?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You know nothing of what I have endured—do not judge how hearts must survive in grief’s shadow!
Hamlet (speaking)

Hamlet (speaking)

Enough of this endless venom! It is neither your place nor your right to hurl accusations at Claudius with no proof, least of all in public!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Proof? What proof would you accept when your eyes are blinded by your hasty marriage bed? My words only reflect the truth you refuse to acknowledge.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not speak to me of truth when your actions wound not only me but the reputation of this house! You act like a petulant child, lashing out in rage, not reason!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, you tread dangerous ground if you defend what is rotten. Have you so quickly forgotten my father's ghost that your conscience no longer stirs?
Gertrude (speaking)  
How dare you speak to me of conscience? My heart is torn enough without your bitter tongue flaying it open again!"

Hamlet, to whom do you cry? Why do you stare so wildly at the darkness—there is nothing there!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Mother, do you not see him? My father's spirit, pale and grave—he beckons me still.
Gertrude (speaking)  
There is no one, Hamlet! My blood runs cold—stop, you frighten me!
Hamlet (speaking)  
He speaks to me, Mother, urges me to remember. I am not mad, I swear it!
Gertrude (speaking)  
You speak to empty air, your eyes burn with fever. Oh my son, what has possessed you?
Hamlet (speaking)  
I beg you, believe me! The vision is as real as you before me. Have you no sense of his presence?

No—no, I see nothing and hear nothing, only your desperate voice. What am I to believe, Hamlet?"

Gertrude (speaking) Shut the door behind you, Hamlet. Dare you show your face after that spectacle before the whole court?
Hamlet (speaking) You summoned me, madam. Is it a crime to hold a mirror to corruption and falsehood?
Gertrude (speaking) Insolence! You dishonored your mother before her king and all her guests—speak plainly, what is it you aim to ruin tonight?
Hamlet (speaking) I aimed at nothing but the truth, which writhes and sickens in these very walls.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not trifle with words, boy! Your wild actions threaten more than your own wretched self—what demon drives you to torment me so?
Hamlet (speaking) It is not madness nor a demon, but a bleeding heart beset by lies and shadow. Why have you married my father's murderer?
Gertrude (speaking) Enough! Your tongue is poison—will you pierce your mother's heart because you are too weak to face your own pain?
Hamlet (speaking) My pain lives in every corner of this cursed chamber, and my mother stands at its center.
Gertrude (speaking) You think yourself brave, scolding your queen—but you are blind, Hamlet, and your spite will lead us all to ruin!"

Gertrude (speaking)  
There is nothing, Hamlet! I see no one, you frighten me—what is it haunts you?

Oh God, you’re not yourself! The air is empty, you speak to things that are not, my son—are you lost to madness?"
