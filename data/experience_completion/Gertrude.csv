unaware and unfortunate,Gertrude drinks from the poisoned goblet meant for Hamlet and dies.,"The poisoned goblet meant for Hamlet stands on the banquet table, and Gertrude, unaware of its contents, takes a drink and meets her tragic fate.
Gertrude (thinking) I am terribly parched, a sudden dryness catching at my throat amid all these tense faces, the air thick with anticipation and rivalry—my poor Hamlet so pale, and the king’s eyes never still. Yet the cup gleams invitingly, a simple comfort in this fraught hall. Oh, but this is not the time for motherly nerves. Still, I must steady myself.
Claudius (speaking) Sweet Gertrude, do not—nay, do not drink of it.
Gertrude (speaking) My lord, why such sudden caution? It is only wine, wished for celebration, for comfort. My Hamlet withers in battle, and my spirit needs mending.
Hamlet (speaking) Let her drink, my uncle, or do you think the table itself is treacherous? My mother is well able to drink as well as any man here.
Laertes (speaking) The queen would bless the match with her regard—I see no harm, madam.
Gertrude (thinking) What strange looks! My heart beats unquiet—yet what reason have I to fear? Claudius's warning chills me. But surely… surely he means nothing. How could wine be dangerous at feasting? I should calm myself. I shall drink; if only for courage.
Gertrude (speaking) I drink to thee, Hamlet, and to your fortune in this contest.
Hamlet (speaking) To my mother’s health—may she never have cause to mourn.
Claudius (speaking) Indeed, the queen drinks happiness for all of us.
Gertrude (thinking) The wine is sweet. Cold on my tongue, a relief after so much worry. My fingers tremble around the cup—but that is just the strain of watching my son clash with death, sword to sword. One sip more. I wish I could set the world right for him.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, what troubles you? You look pale.
Gertrude (thinking) It is nothing, child. Perhaps the heat of the contest. My heart—oh, what odd heaviness. Why does my pulse drum so loud? Is it only dread, or something else? My breath grows tight. I must not show alarm; not now.
Gertrude (speaking) It is nothing, Hamlet. Only the press of so many painted eyes in this crowded hall. Drink, and then victory. I shall soon laugh at my own faintness.
Laertes (speaking) The match grows tense, princess, but take heart. Your son is fierce.
Claudius (speaking) All eyes are on the prince—none will call the queen timid.
Gertrude (thinking) There is a thickness at my throat. My limbs—how heavy they feel, as though gravity presses tenfold. What did my husband mean, that warning? Was it jest? I… my sight swims.
Gertrude (speaking) My head lightens, strange, as if dream-threads tug my mind. What—what was in that cup? My lord, what did you bid me not to drink?
Claudius (speaking) The cup!—the cup! Oh, Gertrude, do not speak of it.
Hamlet (speaking) Speak on, mother—what ails you? You stagger.
Gertrude (thinking) Oh, God. A pain sharpens in my belly, burning like poison—I cannot… cannot draw breath. Claudius is frightened, Hamlet demands answers—my tongue clouds.
Gertrude (speaking) I feel... I feel sick. As if fire courses through me. My limbs fail me—what is happening? Did you see his glance, Hamlet—your father’s?
Claudius (speaking) She swoons to see them bleed—nothing more. She is unwell, yes, but it will pass.
Hamlet (speaking) No, something is wrong. The queen is not herself. Mother, hold to me—what passes in your heart?
Gertrude (thinking) Do I die? Can this be death? Is it only fear, or have I—have I erred so gravely? My son’s face blurs. I wish to warn him, but the world slips sideways. The king steps back—avoidance, not concern. This tremor… these spasms through my body… Have I been a fool, or have I been betrayed?
Gertrude (speaking) No, not fear... not love. The drink—oh, Hamlet, beware the drink... The cup, my son. There is illness there, danger... your father’s eyes lie, they lie.
Hamlet (speaking) Poisoned? My mother—poisoned? Who did this? King, answer! Are you struck dumb by your own treachery?
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, my soul’s joy—I did not—my hands are clean. She is fevered, dreams in her distress.
Laertes (speaking) (aside, to Hamlet) The cup was meant for you; the king prepared it. I am but half alive with guilt. The queen—she has paid for the plot’s shadow.
Gertrude (thinking) Poison. For Hamlet... not for me. Oh God, is this my end? My mistakes gather—my haste, my blindness. I loved too blindly, too easily led—my poor boy, I did not protect you, I... The ache grows, dull at first but now sharp, terrible, grasping at my insides.
Gertrude (speaking) Forgive me, Hamlet... forgive a mother who saw too little, knew too little... this wound is not of the body only. Mind and heart—both poisoned. Take care. You are all I have ever loved.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, mother! Stay with me! Speak again. Curse this day—curse the king’s hand if yours falls slack.
Claudius (speaking) Guards! Remove her—help her! The queen is ill, she needs air, remove her.
Gertrude (thinking) The hall is spinning, voices stretch and tangle. No help comes; only coldness at my spine, the taste of wine turned acrid at the back of my throat. My son’s anger—righteous, wild—my husband’s guilt, oozing from his trembling mouth. I am slipping—slipping.
Gertrude (speaking) Let me lie... let me rest my head, Hamlet... My vision is rimmed with darkness, but I would have you near, my son. Remember me not for this, but for morning sunlight, for laughter at your cradle.
Hamlet (speaking) I am here, mother—always here. Who did it? Speak once more.
Gertrude (thinking) If only I could turn these last moments to warning. If only my voice would not fail. But I am so tired. Each inhale is work, each beat of my heart a mountain to climb. Is this what death is? Not terror, but a slow unfolding, an emptying of self? Still, I ache for Hamlet. Is he safe? I cannot know.
Gertrude (speaking) Beware the king... beware his gifts... Oh, Hamlet, I would have shielded you if I but knew. Forgive me. Forgive.
Laertes (speaking) Too late, all ruined. The king—ay, he poisoned the cup, meant for Hamlet, and the queen unwitting drank.
Hamlet (speaking) Monster! King, confess and cower—my mother, my mother is struck!
Claudius (speaking) Stand from her, Hamlet—she is raving, the poison not known to me. The match—let it finish, we must not lose decorum—
Gertrude (thinking) Still, he lies. The venom in my veins is nothing to his falsehood. I wish I could scream. My fingers tremble, reaching for Hamlet, touch his hair as I did long ago. My tongue is thick, words slipping away into the shadows still clinging to my mind.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, I am cold—so cold. Let the light find you, my son. Shed my mistakes.
Hamlet (speaking) Stay. Do not close your eyes!
Gertrude (thinking) I see only shapes—ghostly, flickering. Did I ever love truly, did I choose wrong at every turn? My heart beats, fragile butterfly, trapped in a glass. Sound is distant, muffled, like thunder far away. My body jerks. I cannot hold on much longer.
Gertrude (speaking) O God—my sight... darkness comes. Hamlet, my child—remember... oh, remember—
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, Gertrude—oh no, what have I done? This cannot—
Laertes (speaking) Justice at last, for all of us. But paid in blood undeserving.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Stay! You cannot leave—answer me! Mother!
Gertrude (thinking) Let me let go. The pain lessens. Only sadness now. Hamlet’s voice is all I hear—his face, the last thing I see.
Gertrude (speaking) Good night, sweet prince... remember me... remember...
She slumps, lifeless, arms falling to her sides. The poisoned wine spills, forgotten, at Hamlet’s feet. All watch, frozen—history pivots, the king’s guilt laid bare in one tragic, unknowing sacrifice."
worried,Gertrude joins Claudius in concern over Hamlet's erratic actions.,"Background: Gertrude joins Claudius in concern over Hamlet's erratic actions.
Gertrude (thinking) I cannot ignore it any longer—his wild eyes, his sudden storms of words, the cold silence that swallows up the air at supper. Hamlet, my son, has slipped beyond my reach. Once his laughter rang through Elsinore’s halls; now the shadows swallow him, each day stranger than the last. Claudius’s whispers of fear have found their way to my heart. I need to make sense of Hamlet—save him, perhaps, or save myself from the storm about to break.
Gertrude (speaking) Claudius, there is such trouble in the castle that I find I cannot sleep. My thoughts twist round Hamlet’s oddness—his looks that strike through my soul, his speech hawthorn-sharp, bursting with meanings I cannot catch. Have you felt it—the shift in the air when he enters, how all the world presses close to hear his next strange utterance? What are we to do? Speak to me.
Claudius (speaking) My queen, his behavior pricks at every nerve of state and peace. He is not the Hamlet of yesterday, nor even this morning’s son. The courtiers whisper that madness stirs within him—but I, I fear more: a soul turned against itself, or against us. Gertrude, if we do not act, what storms might break from such a mind unchecked?
Gertrude (thinking) His words frighten me, yet I know not if it’s reason or madness that compels him so. Even as I long to trust in his innocence, the memory of his father’s death lingers—a shadow cast over our union and Hamlet both. My heart is caught between guilt and fear.
Gertrude (speaking) I see—your worry mirrors mine. Yet I cannot bear the thought of giving him over to force or exile. He is my son, Claudius. I must believe some pain—some wound I cannot see—drives this darkness in him. Have you spoken with him closely? Has he revealed anything—some grudge or suspicion that gnaws at him?
Claudius (speaking) He hems and haws, turns every question into a riddle. When I ask him of his studies, he answers in riddles; speak of his father, he looks through me as if I am nothing but mist. My dear, I have tried patience, I have tried command, yet nothing brings forth the truth of his disquiet.
Gertrude (thinking) What if we have made him so, Claudius? Our marriage came too soon. The court did not smile—surely Hamlet frowned deepest of all. Perhaps he holds our haste, our happiness, as a crime. Perhaps every look he gives me is an accusation.
Gertrude (speaking) Perhaps… perhaps the fault lies with me. I cannot ignore the wound our marriage has dealt him: he lost a father, then a mother to another so quickly. He loves me still, but his love is tangled with anger. If I could unpick those knots, perhaps he would return to himself.
Claudius (speaking) My queen, you have ever been gentle, but too much softness can salt the wound. He is a prince—a man now, not a child to be rocked to sleep! Denmark needs stability, not grief. If Hamlet cannot master himself, then for Denmark’s sake, we must master him.
Gertrude (thinking) That cold certainty in Claudius’s voice chills me. Does he fear Hamlet for love of Denmark—or for fear that his crimes, if Hamlet knows, will unmask him? I cannot trust Claudius completely. But I cannot ignore Denmark, either.
Gertrude (speaking) What mastery do you speak of, Claudius? If you mean harshness, I beg you—remember that love can heal what knives only cut deeper. Let us not think of banishment or chains. Is there not some other way—a friend who might reach his heart, or some wise counsel to draw out his secrets?
Claudius (speaking) Polonius believes that love—young Ophelia’s love—has driven Hamlet mad. He proposes we set a trap… that we let the girl speak with him while we watch unseen. If it is love’s wound, then we shall know, and perhaps a gentle cure presents itself.
Gertrude (thinking) Polonius is cunning, but I have not seen the fire of love in Hamlet’s eye for Ophelia. His heart seems elsewhere—on some darkness only he knows. Yet, perhaps it is worth the trial; if not love, then perhaps the play will reveal a deeper malady.
Gertrude (speaking) Let it be tried, if you think it wise. Ophelia’s sweetness may coax some tenderness from him, or at least show us what sympathy remains. But promise me, Claudius—if this does not heal him, you will not rush to judgment. He is no traitor. He is my son.
Claudius (speaking) I promise you, Gertrude, no harm shall come to him while I hold the throne. Only caution and care, for your sake—and for his. But let us not forget: many eyes watch us. If word spreads that Hamlet is truly lost, Denmark’s enemies may see weakness and strike.
Gertrude (thinking) I hear the threat beneath his promise: Hamlet’s safety is not his first concern. My hands tremble. If the court believes Hamlet mad, I may lose both son and kingdom in a single stroke.
Gertrude (speaking) Then let us be wary with appearances. If Hamlet’s pain is known, it is only the pain of a grieving son—not the madness some would name as treason. Let me speak with him as well, Claudius, before Polonius’s scheme is played out. A mother’s words may reach where a king’s cannot.
Claudius (speaking) As you will, Gertrude. Speak with him—draw from him, if you can, what shadow haunts him. Report to me every word, every look. If you find cause for hope, I shall heed your counsel. But if not—then we must act, and swiftly.
Gertrude (thinking) My fate hangs by a thread, drawn between husband and son. I love them both, though love for Claudius is stricken with guilt, and love for Hamlet with terror. My nerves are frayed; each moment with Hamlet now is a walk over ice, thin and ready to crack.
Gertrude (speaking) Tonight, I will find him. Perhaps in the gallery, or along the ramparts where he paces in the cold. I shall speak gently and beg him for the truth of his discomfort. If there is a way back for him, I shall find it. If he is lost, then may God have mercy on us all.
Claudius (speaking) You are brave, my queen. My faith rides on you. Should you learn anything, let me know—no detail is too slight.
Gertrude (thinking) Brave. If only he knew the dread that runs like ice water through my marrow. To confess the truth—my haste in marriage, my secret pity for Hamlet’s anger—would be to betray them both. But if I do nothing, I am an accomplice to whatever doom grows between these men.
Gertrude (speaking) There is one more thing, Claudius. Hamlet’s visitations—he keeps strange hours, muttering to shadows, staring into corners as if listening for voices. Has none observed him closely at night? I fear he courts spirits—perhaps even vengeance.
Claudius (speaking) Some say he talks to nothing—walls or wind. Others report that he has been seen on the battlements, shivering at midnight. But none have dared approach him, my queen. If the dead do walk, let us pray that Hamlet is not their messenger.
Gertrude (thinking) Spirits—my mind wavers between superstition and sense. Could it be conscience, not the dead, that has returned to plague us all? What if Hamlet knows more than he should—what if his madness hides a dreadful purpose?
Gertrude (speaking) I understand. Still, I beg you—do not mark him as dangerous before we know for certain what seeds his madness has sown. Promise me again that you will do no harm.
Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, you have my word—so long as hope remains, we will trust in gentler remedies. If hope fails… then duty must rule me.
Gertrude (thinking) I do not trust his hope—or his word. But what choice have I? I will guard Hamlet as I can—with words, with watching, with prayers whispered in the dark. If I must choose, I will choose my son, come ruin or regret.
Gertrude (speaking) Then let us part for now, Claudius. I will seek out Hamlet. Pray that I bring back news to still our fears.
Claudius (speaking) Go, my queen. Denmark depends upon your strength, as do I.
Gertrude (thinking) Denmark, son, husband—none of these loves sits easily with me tonight. The air is thick with secrets. Perhaps the truth, when at last it dawns, will shatter us all. Yet I must try. For Hamlet—for myself—I will brave the gathering storm and hope the dawn finds us still whole."

Gertrude (thinking) The clamor in the hall is almost musical—the bright laughter, the burst of applause as Hamlet and Laertes circle each other, swords flashing, silver on silver. My son is ferocious, his cheeks flushed behind the black mask. Yet Claudius’ hand on my waist is gentle, the sign of his enjoyment as he watches the sport unfold. My heart is giddy—not only from the spectacle, from the hope threading through this celebration, but from the sheer air of peace after months of sorrow. My mouth is dry with anticipation.
Hamlet (speaking) A touch! A touch, I do confess.
Laertes (speaking) No, no! A pass, my lord, merely grazed.
King Claudius (speaking) Our son finds his vigor tonight! Gertrude, you see how he shines? The pride of Denmark indeed.
Gertrude (speaking) His skill is dazzling, he gleams—how my heart swells with every movement on the floor. Though I pray, husband, nothing is strained, no pride wounded; let it be only a friendly contest.
King Claudius (speaking) By my soul, it is all in goodwill. They are but young men letting their energy dance before us. Peace, dear heart.
Gertrude (thinking) The goblets sparkle on the table, condensation running luxurious and cool down their graceful stems. The air tastes metallic, excitement humming just beneath my skin. Ophelia’s absence lingers at the corners, but tonight feels different: hope, renewal, perhaps.
Laertes (speaking) I thank you, Prince Hamlet, for your forbearance and for meeting me honestly.
Hamlet (speaking) Laertes, I do indeed bear love for you—the rest is silence. We are caught in fortune’s web, but may the gods favor us both.
King Claudius (speaking) Well spoken! Well spoken both! We must offer them more than applause. Steward, the wine!
Gertrude (thinking) The servants glide forward, silver platters trembling only a little. I catch my own reflection in the polished goblet—my eyes are bright. I am not old, not yet; tonight, I am the queen of a happy court.
Steward (speaking) My lady, wine for your refreshment?
Gertrude (speaking) You know I cannot refuse—my nerves flutter almost as much as yours, dear Hamlet!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, for you to watch is gift enough.
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet’s face is pale from exertion, but there’s a softness in his eyes—a boyishness I believed lost. I lift my goblet, a cheer rises, the wine sweet and red as a June rose.
King Claudius (speaking) Give him this cup, Hamlet—fortify your skill! The drink is worthy of a champion.
Hamlet (speaking) I’ll play another bout first, my lord. Let the best blade decide.
Laertes (speaking) Then let us on.
Gertrude (speaking) I drink to their fortune, to peace between them, to Denmark’s days of calm ahead! (She raises her goblet and drinks.)
Gertrude (thinking) The wine is cool, sharp. Something unfamiliar traces the back of my throat, but the sweetness sweeps it away. I lean into Claudius’ arm, smiling, unaware of the faint tremor in his hand.
King Claudius (speaking) [voice low] Don’t drink! Gertrude, do not…[trails off as she drinks]
Gertrude (speaking) What is it, husband? Did you call to me?
King Claudius (speaking) (forced brightness) Only—your health, my queen. I marvel at your spirit.
Gertrude (thinking) Strange, the sudden chill in his eyes—he looks past me, weighing something heavy.
Laertes (speaking) On guard, Hamlet!
Hamlet (speaking) Always, Laertes! For my mother, I cannot lose.
Gertrude (thinking) My vision blurs for a flicker of a moment, edges of the world trembling like uncertain candlelight. I laugh, trying to dispel the odd sensation. My tongue prickles.
Gertrude (speaking) How warm it is in here. The match is so bright, I find myself dizzy with pride—the strength of our sons!
King Claudius (speaking) (urgently, softly) Gertrude, perhaps…perhaps you should rest?
Gertrude (thinking) There is a tightness now at the root of my throat, but I cannot draw away—so much to witness, so many eyes on me. To sit, to rest, would be to surrender my joy.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, do you look unwell? Shall I call for water?
Gertrude (speaking) No, beloved, do not alarm yourself—it is only the excitement. The room spins with happiness and laughter. 
Gertrude (thinking) But as I say it, the cold intensifies. My heart skips, then pounds, then seems to stumble oddly. The taste of metal sharpens, the edges of my teeth ache. Still, I must not betray any weakness.
Laertes (speaking) (as swords cross) You fight well!—ah, what a contest!
Gertrude (speaking) Wonderful! Such valor! This day is a blessing.
(Gertrude’s vision flickers; the sounds of cheering are distant, muffled, the room darker at the edges.)
Gertrude (thinking) My hands tremble. I try to steady the goblet, but the weight increases, pulling me toward the floor. Do they see me? I must not ruin the celebration, not now. Another sip? No. My stomach twists.
Gertrude (speaking) Claudius, I…I feel very faint. The lights are too bright. Would you—would you help me sit?
King Claudius (speaking) [rising swiftly] My queen! Stewards, to her side!
Hamlet (speaking) Mother, hold! What is this?
Gertrude (thinking) Hamlet’s voice draws panic in the air—all eyes are on me now. I would soothe him, but my tongue feels wooden. My lips are numb.
Gertrude (speaking) It’s nothing, Hamlet. Please, go on—don’t stop the match! We all so needed joy, tonight. I beg you to play.
Horatio (speaking) My lady, your color fades; what ails you?
Gertrude (thinking) The pain arrives like a rushing sea. My inside coils and freezes, every breath a chasm. I want to answer Horatio, want to speak, but the very attempt is agony.
Gertrude (speaking) I don’t know—my chest, it burns—my veins like ice. It cannot be—surely not—could the wine be so strong?
King Claudius (speaking) (in a low, frantic voice) She…she swoons to see them bleed.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Gods, what is it? Speak, sweet mother!
Gertrude (thinking) My thoughts collapse, reeling back through winters and springs—little feet running through the castle, Hamlet’s first smile, Ophelia gathering violets for my hair. Why does it hurt so much? Is this death, then? It comes too soon. I feel so cold.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet…my child…if only—if only I could—
Horatio (speaking) She is fading, fetch a physician, quick!
Gertrude (thinking) Why does Claudius look so pale, his lips drawn tight? He will not meet my eyes. What does he know? All the world is spinning—
Gertrude (speaking) Husband…what is…what have you done? The wine…my heart—it gives out.
King Claudius (speaking) Gertrude, hold! Doctors, fetch water!
Hamlet (speaking) The cup! What is there in that cup? O God, mother!
Gertrude (thinking) The pain is all colors—white, red, a pulsing shadow at the edge of my mind. I cannot move, cannot hold Hamlet’s hand. I want to warn him…danger, the cup, the cup is not safe.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet…do not drink. The cup—the cup is poisoned—oh—oh!
(Gertrude collapses, the goblet slipping from her grasp, wine pooling on the floor.)
Gertrude (thinking) My body is heavy, ice in my veins crawling towards my heart. I hear the sob from Hamlet, the scrape of boots against the stone, the distant shouts—blurred, muffled, receding.
Hamlet (speaking) Mother! Mother, stay with me!
King Claudius (speaking) Gentlemen, restrain Hamlet! Find help!
Gertrude (thinking) It is so quiet now. The shouts melt away and I am alone, drifting—perhaps into memory, perhaps into nothing. Hamlet’s hand is warm against mine but grows distant, his voice a murmur through water.
Gertrude (speaking) Forgive me…forgive one who knew so little. I loved so much, my Hamlet…remember me gentle…Oh—
Horatio (speaking) She is gone. Hamlet, the queen is dead—alas, alas!
Gertrude (thinking) If there is peace after pain, let it reach him—let it reach us all. The world shrinks to a single point of light. I am floating, I am falling, I am free.
——
Gertrude (thinking) The darkness spreads at the edges, cool and final. The weight of the crown, the burden of silence, none of it matters now. My last sensation is my son’s hand, my last thought a hope for forgiveness.
(The scene ends as Gertrude’s vision fades to black, the sound of Hamlet’s anguish echoing in the vast, chilled hall.)"
