Laertes (speaking)  
I ache for vengeance, my lord, but honor weighs on me. What design could outpace the prince’s cunning?
Claudius (speaking)  
We summon sport—a match of blades, unsuspecting and fair to every eye but ours. Yet beneath your sleeve, you shall bear a point envenomed, deadly to first touch.
Laertes (speaking)  
A poisoned blade? Such subterfuge sickens me, yet for my father and my sister, I will see Hamlet bled.
Claudius (speaking)  
Resolve steels the trembling hand, Laertes. With each parry and thrust, let your anger be the poison itself—let none suspect but let all witness Hamlet’s end.
Laertes (speaking)

Claudius (speaking) His words grow stranger, and I sense danger in his silence. Something festers beneath that mournful exterior.
Polonius (speaking) My lord, I have oft observed him from afar. I suspect he is afflicted by love or perhaps some torment of the spirit.
Claudius (speaking) Afflicted, yes! But by what cause? And how shall we draw out the poison festering in his mind?
Gertrude (speaking) Might we speak to him openly, as mother and king? He once confided in me before this veil of gloom descended.
Polonius (speaking) If I may, my liege, permit me a scheme. I will arrange for Ophelia to meet with him whilst we conceal ourselves and listen.

Guildenstern (speaking) My lord, shall we make the preparations at once? The prince can be on his way before sundown.
Claudius (speaking) At once, yes, but listen well—England’s not mere exile. Carry sealed command; those who receive Hamlet are to ensure he draws no breath to return.
Rosencrantz (speaking) Sire, is it to such an end? Shall Hamlet meet his fate beyond our shores?
Claudius (speaking) His shadow darkens Denmark, and my peace crumbles; do this, and you serve both your king and your future.
Guildenstern (speaking) It shall be done, your majesty. We will see to every word you have written.
Claudius (speaking) Fail me not, for on this deed my crown—and my life—may rest. Go, and trust no soul with what passes between us here."

Laertes (speaking) My grief claws at me every waking moment, my lord. Give me the means, and by heaven, I shall end his life myself.

Laertes (speaking) A poisoned blade—so be it. But if he evades the cut?
Claudius (speaking) Leave that to me. In the heat of spectacle, I shall offer Hamlet a goblet: wine laced with death. If fate favors him still, he will not escape it.

Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord, I fear for him. His soul seems distant, but if you wish it, I will watch and listen for any sign.
Claudius (speaking)  
Your closeness is a gentle key, Ophelia; Hamlet will trust you where he guards against others. I beg you, share with me whatever you learn.
Ophelia (speaking)  
It troubles me to spy upon the prince, yet if it may save him, I shall do as you ask. How shall I begin?
Claudius (speaking)  
Arrange to meet him, as you often have before—yet now, attend with careful eyes and ears. Let nothing slip unnoticed, for I suspect his mind is no longer his own.
Ophelia (speaking)  
What if he discovers my intentions? Will he not turn further from us both?
Claudius (speaking)  
He must not know; speak to him as you always would. Bring any word or sign directly to me, and I shall guide you hence.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Then I will go to him, gentle and unguarded, and watch for what troubles his heart. I hope only good may come from this.

Claudius (speaking) The danger is not for you to worry after, but for me to cure, and Hamlet is the malady. You need only deliver these letters directly, and mark that all proceeds as instructed.
Guildenstern (speaking) It shall be carried out as you desire, sire. May we inquire—does Hamlet suspect aught?
Claudius (speaking) He suspects shadows, nothing more, but he will follow you. Remember, the King’s commandment is law—do not read the seal, nor question its content, but only serve your King.
Rosencrantz (speaking) We will obey without hesitation, majesty.

Laertes (speaking)  
If it is Hamlet, then let him answer with his life. I burn to confront him face to face—tell me your counsel.
Claudius (speaking)  
There is a way, noble Laertes, one subtle and unassailable. Challenge Hamlet to a friendly match of fence; there your skill may strike deeply, baptized in silent poison.
Laertes (speaking)  
A masked revenge—clever, and he’ll suspect nothing until his lifeblood ebbs. Shall we prepare now, or wait for opportunity?
Claudius (speaking)  
Delay invites suspicion; act swiftly and I shall wager heavily on you, ensuring Hamlet cannot refuse. The world will applaud your victory, and none shall know the price.
Laertes (speaking)  
If he escapes my blade, what then, my lord? What assurance have I that fortune won’t slip my grasp?
Claudius (speaking)  
We shall have a chalice ready, full of poisoned wine—a toast for his health, a final draught for his soul. All avenues covered, my friend; not even Providence can interfere now.

Rosencrantz (speaking) My lord, we have observed him oft paced and silent, his eyes fixed as if on some vision unseen. He speaks little, yet when pressed, gives answers twisted and strange.
Guildenstern (speaking) Indeed, Majesty, he greets joy with a mournful shadow, and at times seems to feign madness, perhaps to shield his true intent.
Claudius (speaking) Feign, you say? I have long suspected his mind to play tricks, yet I must know if his grief is mere pretense, or proof of danger to my reign.
Rosencrantz (speaking) Sire, we shall draw closer in friendship and conversation, in hopes he confides the cause of his discontent.
Claudius (speaking) So do, and let not his wit elude you—search him subtly, root out the heart of his disquiet. If he harbors thoughts against me, I must be the first to learn them.

Polonius (speaking) Yet still, my lord, I did observe him with your daughter; his sighs were deep, his gaze distraught—surely, affection wrings his heart.  
Claudius (speaking) Affection? Nay, I have seen coarser motives kindle wits to frenzy—there’s something rank beneath his feigned affection.  
Gertrude (speaking) I worry for him, husband. His words trouble me, yes, but there’s hurt beneath all that fury.  
Claudius (speaking) Hurt, perhaps, but not for love. The boy’s eyes search the corners, seeking—what, I cannot say, but it reeks not of heartbreak.  
Polonius (speaking) Shall we then press him further, test him with Ophelia again?  
Claudius (speaking) No, the time for gentle coaxing is past. We must watch him, and I shall trust no one with his secrets but myself.  
Gertrude (speaking) He is your blood, Claudius. Take care that suspicion does not blind you to his pain.

Gertrude (speaking) My lord, what troubles you? The play was but a fiction—why such disquiet on your brow?
Claudius (speaking) It is nothing, nothing but shadows of the past, yet I cannot breathe beneath their weight.
Polonius (speaking) Sire, perhaps you should retire; these dramatics unsettle the heart, but all is well.
Claudius (speaking) No, Polonius, it is not well; I feel a thousand eyes pierce through my flesh—leave me, all of you, at once!"
"determined, fearful",Decides Hamlet must be sent to England after witnessing the play.,"After witnessing the re-enactment of King Hamlet’s murder onstage, Claudius’s suspicion and alarm have reached a breaking point, and he is determined that Hamlet must be sent away to England.
Claudius (speaking) Rosencrantz, Guildenstern—come here at once. The time has come: Hamlet cannot remain at Elsinore a day longer.
Rosencrantz (speaking) My lord, is this not sudden? What has Prince Hamlet done to deserve exile?
Claudius (speaking) His every word now rings of accusation; his madness is not feigned, but dangerous. You saw how his gaze pierced me during the play.
Guildenstern (speaking) We see your trouble, sire. What would you have us do with him?
Claudius (speaking) You will accompany him, both of you, as loyal friends—but make no mistake, England must receive him. Ensure he does not return until I send for him.
Rosencrantz (speaking) If we may ask, what shall be told to Hamlet, and to the Queen?

Claudius (speaking)  
Enough of your riddles! Tell me plainly, where have you secreted the corpse? Your madness endangers us all.  
Hamlet (speaking)  
He’s not where he eats, but where he is eaten—a certain convocation of worms are e’en at him.  
Claudius (speaking)  
You mock me at every turn! Foolish boy, you defile what little mercy I might offer. Rosencrantz, Guildenstern—stand ready!  
Rosencrantz (speaking)  
My lord, shall we seize him?  
Guildenstern (speaking)  
Just say the word—he cannot outwit us.  
Claudius (speaking)

Hamlet (speaking)  
England or Hell—what’s one more prison? Which betrayal is next, uncle?

Claudius (speaking)  
Laertes, rage is a storm that blinds even the keenest sight; sit, and let calm reason guide your vengeance. The man who struck your father down is not before you—Hamlet, reckless and wild, committed this dark deed.
Laertes (speaking)  
Hamlet? You say 'tis he who robbed me of my father? Why is he not brought to justice?
Claudius (speaking)  
I share your outrage, yet my hands are bound by the love the people bear him, and by his mother’s tears. Know this: I grieve for Polonius as deeply as you do, but to seize Hamlet openly would inflame the realm.
Laertes (speaking)  
Am I to accept this? While my heart burns with grief, Hamlet walks the halls unscathed!
Claudius (speaking)  
What justice demands, we shall pursue, but with cunning—let Hamlet’s crimes be laid bare for all to see. Join with me, and I will help you see vengeance done, rightly and without scandal."

Claudius (speaking) Laertes, our purpose must not falter—Hamlet has brought us both to the edge, and tonight he faces his reckoning. Will your hand be steady when you meet him in the arena, as we arranged?
Laertes (speaking) My resolve is iron; the venom on my blade will do its work swiftly, if fortune favors.
Claudius (speaking) The court loves spectacle—let them think this a sportive match, while hidden death weaves its way. Yet, should he escape your thrust, I have prepared a goblet laced with a draught no mortal can withstand.
Laertes (speaking) All avenues are covered, my lord. But what if Hamlet suspects we scheme?
Claudius (speaking) He suspects nothing—grief blinds him, and pride will lure him into our trap. At the toast, act natural while I offer the fatal cup.
Laertes (speaking) My vengeance will strike as clean as your plan is cunning; we shall be free of him.

Claudius (speaking)  
He circles the court with vacant eyes, rejecting his friends and feigning wit—can love alone unravel the mind so thoroughly?
Gertrude (speaking)  
You doubt the reason, my lord? Ophelia has withdrawn from him; heartbreak can wound deeply.
Claudius (speaking)  
Something in his speeches disturbs me—such riddles and sly glances. He knows more than he tells.
Polonius (speaking)  
I still hold that lost affection is the root, but perhaps there is another parasite upon his reason.
Claudius (speaking)  
No, Polonius, his purpose is too pointed, too wary. There is method lurking in his frenzy.
Gertrude (speaking)

Gertrude (speaking) If you should need me, I will not be far.
Claudius (speaking) Good. Go, now.
Rosencrantz (speaking) Your majesty, how fares your mood? You summoned us with urgency.
Claudius (speaking) There is a madness growing in this place, a rot that spreads from Hamlet himself. He must be removed, lest all be undone.

At supper, my lord—but not where he eats, rather where he is eaten. Seek him in the lobby, if you dare.
Claudius (speaking)  
Your riddles try my patience and my rule. If you will not divulge his resting place, expect England’s air to clear your troubled mind.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I am prepared for travel, though I doubt the wind in England tastes much better than here.
Claudius (speaking)  
Indeed, your voyage begins tonight—guides await to steer you far from Denmark’s wounded heart.
Hamlet (speaking)  
And what message rides with me, uncle? A tender greeting or a dagger wrapped in wax?
Claudius (speaking)  
Words intended only for England’s king—trust that he knows how to treat wayward souls.
Hamlet (speaking)  
My soul, then, shall greet him before my body does—if your wishes run so deep.
Claudius (speaking)  
Enough; I'll trust my designs to loyal hands. Escort Hamlet safely and swiftly, for the good of us all."

Claudius (speaking) My noble lords and loving queen, our union binds the crown anew, yet shadows linger from Norway’s restless prince. I propose we answer Fortinbras’ stirrings not by the sword, but with the tongue of parley and peace.
Gertrude (speaking) My heart is light with our newfound joy, but troubled still by talk of invasion. Can we trust this young prince to heed our message?
Polonius (speaking) Your Majesty, eloquence is your shield; send envoys swift and let our gold sweeten Norway’s ear, quelling ambition.
Fortinbras’ Ambassador (speaking) Our prince seeks only what he feels justly owed, yet he would listen and honor Denmark’s word if met with respect.
Claudius (speaking) Let us show Norway that Denmark’s strength lies as much in her reason as her wrath; we shall welcome parley and offer amends where wisdom guides."

Claudius (speaking) I have summoned you both here for a matter most grave; Hamlet's mind troubles me, and the cause eludes my reach. Have you noticed nothing odd, no sign to explain this disorder?
Rosencrantz (speaking) My lord, he greets us with warmth, yet his eyes wander as if searching for meaning in shadows.
Guildenstern (speaking) He speaks in riddles, majesty, avoiding the heart of every question—guarded, even with old friends.
Claudius (speaking) This is most vexing. Has he confided anything—a word, a whisper--that might hint at what drives these storms within him?
Rosencrantz (speaking) Nothing clear, sire. He changes topic or falls silent when we draw too near his thoughts.
Guildenstern (speaking) If there is torment in him, he masks it well, though we sense some hidden grief festers deep.
Claudius (speaking) You must press him further, with subtlety and care—whatever plagues him, I must know its name, and soon."
"suspicious, determined",Decides that Hamlet is not mad for love of Ophelia but for another reason.,"Background: Claudius, after witnessing Hamlet's recent behavior, has become convinced that Hamlet is not mad for love of Ophelia but for some darker, hidden reason.
Claudius (speaking) There is more to Hamlet’s madness than meets the eye, Polonius. I see calculation in his gaze, not the wildness of a broken heart.
Polonius (speaking) My lord, he swore Ophelia drew him to this state—his letters attest to it, as does his conduct.
Claudius (speaking) Letters can lie, and conduct is but a mask. He is driven by purpose, not passion.
Gertrude (speaking) Husband, you grow pale. Do you fear Hamlet has seen through our affairs?
Claudius (speaking) His words ring with double meaning, Gertrude. Every glance cuts deeper than the last—I cannot dismiss the threat.
Polonius (speaking) You would have us abandon our watch upon Ophelia, then? If not for love, then what torment haunts the prince?
Claudius (speaking) That is what I must uncover, and swiftly. Hamlet hides a blade behind his smiles—I will not wait to feel its edge."
"shaken, guilty",Is disturbed by the play and decides he must get rid of Hamlet by sending him to England.,"After being deeply disturbed by the play, Claudius is unnerved and resolves that he must send Hamlet away to England to get rid of him.

Guildenstern (speaking)  
We are here, my lord. How may we serve?
Claudius (speaking)  
You have seen the unrest that boils within Hamlet. Do you consider him fit to remain at court?
Rosencrantz (speaking)  
He unsettles all, my lord; his words are daggers, and his mood sharpens by the hour.
Claudius (speaking)  
It is so. You both must take him hence, at once, to England—do not question, and do not fail me.

Claudius (speaking)  
Hamlet, your madness breeds chaos in this court. Tell me now—where is Polonius's body?
Hamlet (speaking)  
You seek him with such haste, my lord, yet are slower than the wind to find the truth. Polonius lies where he's eaten, not where he's slain.
Claudius (speaking)  
Do not trifle with me, boy—this is no time for riddles. Reveal the place, or you seal your own fate.
Hamlet (speaking)  
I will not be manipulated by your threats; send your messengers, set them sniffing like dogs. The old man will be found by the stench he leaves behind.
Claudius (speaking)  
Enough! You force my hand, Hamlet. Prepare yourself—you leave for England tonight, escorted and watched.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Send me where you will, uncle. England, Denmark, hell—what difference to a man haunted?
Claudius (speaking)  
The difference is final, Hamlet. Guard! See him secured, and fetch the dispatch; England awaits your coming, and my letter ensures they welcome you properly."

Laertes, I feel the storm within you, but let not your anger blaze against the innocent walls of this palace. If only you knew the serpent who has poisoned your father’s sleep.
Laertes (speaking)  
Who? Speak plainly, my lord—my hands burn for justice! If you have knowledge, reveal it to me this instant.
Claudius (speaking)  
It pains me, but the truth must be laid bare: it was Hamlet who so rashly struck and silenced your father’s voice. He is the source of your suffering.
Laertes (speaking)  
Hamlet? Is it so? I scarce can believe he would, yet my blood demands satisfaction for my father’s fall.
Claudius (speaking)  
Your grief is righteous, your fury just. Together, we must ensure Hamlet answers for the deed that drenched this house in tears.
Laertes (speaking)  
But what of justice, and what of royal law? Will you not stand in my path, my king?
Claudius (speaking)  
You shall have my hand, not as a king to a subject but as a fellow wounded soul, resolved to see Hamlet punished for all he hath destroyed."

Claudius (speaking)  
Laertes, our hour approaches. Listen well: the fencing contest offers us a most exquisite opportunity.
Laertes (speaking)  
My lord, I hunger for justice. What weapon do you propose to ensure Hamlet's end?
Claudius (speaking)  
You shall wield a rapier with a venomed tip—one scratch and it is done. But should he escape, I have prepared a chalice touched with like poison.
Laertes (speaking)  
Such cunning! If fortune fails the blade, the wine shall finish what steel cannot.
Claudius (speaking)  
Indeed, neither chance nor Providence will rescue him. Your skill and my craft will see our revenge fulfilled.
Laertes (speaking)  
Say but the word, my king, and I shall begin this cruel sport at your signal.
Claudius (speaking)  
Hold, keep your demeanor cordial, let suspicion see no trace—for tonight, appearances must cloak our true designs.
Laertes (speaking)  
He will never suspect me, not until his blood's warmth fades.
Claudius (speaking)  
We play for everything, Laertes; lose your nerve, and all is lost. Are you certain you are resolute?
Laertes (speaking)  
I swore by my slain father, Claudius: I will not falter, be it steel or deadly sip.
Claudius (speaking)  
Excellent. Let us go to the hall; Hamlet meets his fate tonight, by one means—or another—he will not leave this place alive."

Claudius (speaking) Sweet Prince Hamlet, your arm outshines even Laertes—truly, you are the darling of this match. Will you not grace your parched lips with this goblet? A king’s toast to your triumph!
Hamlet (speaking) My lord, I thank you, but my blood is warm with contest still. Let the bout roll on a moment more.
Gertrude (speaking) Hamlet, your brow is damp. Drink, and put your mother’s heart at ease—for worry consumes me.
Claudius (speaking) The cup is yours, madam, yet I had reserved it for Hamlet. But who would dispute a mother’s care?
Hamlet (speaking) My thanks, mother, but in good faith—I’ll not drink ‘til victory is honest and whole.
Laertes (speaking) His spirit is unyielding, majesty. Perhaps fortune changes yet.
Claudius (speaking) Perhaps, Laertes. Let fortune choose her champion, but let my love choose who to celebrate."
"conscience-stricken, panicked","Claudius reacts to the play by leaving the room, revealing his guilt to Hamlet.","The moment the play mimics the King's murder, Claudius abruptly rises and flees, exposing his guilt to Hamlet.
Claudius (speaking)

Gertrude (speaking)  
My lord, are you unwell? Why do you leave so suddenly?
Claudius (speaking)  
No—it's nothing. I... The air is stifling—I need to clear my head.
Polonius (speaking)  
Your Majesty, shall I fetch your physician? This is most unsettling.
Claudius (speaking)  
No physicians, Polonius. Just bring me to my chambers at once.

Rosencrantz (speaking) My lord, your will is ours; we shall attend the prince and see him delivered as you command. Yet, what darker purpose sits behind your words?
Claudius (speaking) You are loyal—to Denmark, and to me. A letter goes with you, sealed and final; its import is grave, and must not be questioned.
Guildenstern (speaking) We understand, majesty. Is it... his end you demand or only his absence?
Claudius (speaking) The king of England owes me favour—what is written must be done, unflinching. Do not return without your mission finished, or your lives shall answer for your failure.
Rosencrantz (speaking) We are uneasy, my lord—Hamlet suspects us already. If he sees through us, what then?
Claudius (speaking) Then see to it he does not. Use what friendship remains between you, mask your purpose, and move swiftly.
Guildenstern (speaking) Should we falter, sire, is there no mercy to be hoped?
Claudius (speaking) Mercy fled this castle with Polonius’s soul. There is no other path—heed my warning, and let none suspect the danger that shadows Hamlet’s journey.
Rosencrantz (speaking) We obey, though our hearts tremble.
Claudius (speaking) Fear is the hand that shapes kings and grave-diggers alike. Now go—midnight sees Hamlet gone, or I shall wonder if any loyalty lives in Elsinore."

Claudius (speaking)  
Displeased? It claws at my soul, as if the actors wield daggers and know their victim.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Dear husband, why do you tremble so? Sit, I pray you—this is but a fiction on the stage.
Claudius (speaking)  
A fiction, yes, but fiction veils the truth like silk around a blade.
Hamlet (speaking)  
You look as though you’ve seen a ghost, sir. Shall I call a physician?
Claudius (speaking)  
No physician could purge this sickness, nor cleanse what lies upon my hands.
Polonius (speaking)

Claudius (speaking) You misunderstand necessity for cruelty. This prince, untethered, disturbs the peace; England shall be a place for him to cool his fevered blood.

Claudius (speaking)  
Laertes, the cause of all your agony sits harmless in the palace, unpunished, untouched—should I remind you, it was Hamlet who drove his blade through your father’s heart?
Laertes (speaking)  
My blood burns at even the mention of his name; but Ophelia—her mind undone! Are you saying he is the root of her madness too?
Claudius (speaking)  
Who else but Hamlet shattered her world? Every stone in her sorrow lies in the grave he dug for Polonius, every breath of her madness haunted by the prince.
Laertes (speaking)  
Had I only been here! By heaven, Hamlet’s crimes cry out for vengeance—yet some say fate, not he, brought ruin on my house.
Claudius (speaking)  
Fate is blind, but Hamlet chose his acts—he wielded the dagger, he whispered poison to your sister’s heart with each reckless deed.
Laertes (speaking)  
My hands tremble with hatred—what would you have me do? If the law is helpless, what justice can be served?
Claudius (speaking)  
Let law sleep, Laertes; justice is in our hands, and I stand ready to guide yours for the sake of your father and your sister."

Claudius (speaking)  
Laertes, your hand trembles, but your purpose must not. The duel presents us with the perfect stage—strike Hamlet with this envenomed blade and vengeance shall be yours.
Laertes (speaking)  
My resolve is fixed, my lord. Yet if he escapes the point, how else shall our scheme ensnare him?
Claudius (speaking)  
Should fortune shield him from the sword, I have prepared a chalice of rarest wine—laced mortally for Hamlet should thirst claim him amid the fray.
Laertes (speaking)  
Let no mischance betray us. Will none suspect our design?
Claudius (speaking)  
We cloak our intent in the guise of sport; none in Elsinore shall glimpse the wolf beneath this mask.
Laertes (speaking)  
When the trumpet sounds, my blade shall find its mark. Our fates are bound on this blood-stained path.
Claudius (speaking)  
Go now, ready yourself, and steel your heart for what must be done. Tonight, Denmark will be rid of Hamlet, and our crown secure—should either steel or poison find its mark."

Claudius (speaking) This deed of Hamlet’s hath turned the court to chaos, yet—mark me, friends—I cannot let the law take full course upon him. He is dear to the Queen, and to strike would rend her heart in twain.  
Rosencrantz (speaking) My lord, are we to bear him hence, as you commanded?  
Claudius (speaking) Indeed, Rosencrantz; your journey to England must begin forthwith, with Hamlet in your trustful care. I ask only your utmost loyalty and secrecy.  
Guildenstern (speaking) My lord, what are we to tell the Prince regarding this sudden voyage?  
Claudius (speaking) Speak to him of care and favor—say that England’s gentle clime may ease his troubled mind, and hush this storm within our walls.  
Rosencrantz (speaking) And Polonius, my lord? The court murmurs with rumor and grief.  
Claudius (speaking) Let them murmur; grief is the coin of kings, but peace is my purchase. I bear this burden for Denmark—for all, and for none more than the Queen herself.  
Guildenstern (speaking) Should we fear his wrath or madness upon the road?  
Claudius (speaking) Fear not; his mind is restless, yet your watch is trusty. Ensure his swift and safe deliverance to the ship—let no word or whisper reach him of suspicion.  
Rosencrantz (speaking) We obey. You trust us with your will—we shall not fail you, my lord.  
Claudius (speaking) Fail me, and the realm itself falters. Only I know the danger Hamlet’s presence breeds—go, and let Denmark breathe in peace once more."

Claudius (speaking) The hour is late, and darker business must be done. Take these sealed commands to the king of England—his compliance is not in doubt.
Rosencrantz (speaking) My lord, we will not fail you. Is Hamlet to know of this paper’s weight?
Claudius (speaking) Not a whisper must reach his ear. You are simply his companions, nothing more.
Guildenstern (speaking) We serve as shadows, my lord—unseen, unquestioned. But what fate is decreed in England?
Claudius (speaking) Do not trouble yourselves with what is written. England writes its own fate, and Hamlet has a part in it that ends in silence.
Rosencrantz (speaking) We understand, sire. Our loyalty is yours, always.
Guildenstern (speaking) We pray for safe passage and success in your intent.
Claudius (speaking) Pray instead that conscience does not wake to trouble your sleep. Now go—failure is not to be considered."

Claudius (speaking) I know your heart aches with loss, Laertes, but it is Hamlet who wields the dagger behind your family's suffering.  
Laertes (speaking) You speak what I have long suspected, my lord, yet I crave certainty—why would Hamlet aim such cruelty at my house?  
Claudius (speaking) Hamlet, blinded by reckless envy and suspicion, murdered Polonius in cold blood, and now this same poison drips into Ophelia’s fragile mind.  
Laertes (speaking) The madness I see in my dear sister's eyes—do you say Hamlet is the cause, the architect of all this misery?  
Claudius (speaking) None but Hamlet; her gentle spirit shattered by her father’s unlawful death, and Hamlet ever near, twisting grief into madness.  
Laertes (speaking) I cannot bear this, my veins burn with injustice—should I leave this sin unpunished?  
Claudius (speaking) No, Laertes, justice must find its mark, and we shall carve a righteous path to vengeance—for your kin and your peace."

Claudius (speaking) The time is ripe, Laertes. You shall face Hamlet with a blade whose mere scratch dooms him, and none shall suspect the design.
Laertes (speaking) My lord, is this poison so quick and sure? I must have vengeance—yet it chills me to trust in such dark cunning.
Claudius (speaking) The venom is deftly brewed; one prick, and young Hamlet falls. Still, as caution’s twin, I’ll wager royal favor: a goblet laced with death for his parched lips if fortune strays.
Laertes (speaking) This web you spin assures his end, my lord. I will strike without mercy—your promise is enough for me.
Claudius (speaking) Be resolute, Laertes; no soul shall mourn him more than I pretend, and soon Denmark shall be rid of this canker."
