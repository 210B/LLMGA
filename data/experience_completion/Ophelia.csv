Sweet lady, come back from the river’s edge. Your mind is unsettled—let me take you home.

Laertes (speaking)  
Dearest sister, you wander too close to sorrow’s mouth. Please, let go of all that pain—let me bear it with you.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Pain is a garden, Laertes, and every petal is stained with blood. See, the violets withered when I sang of him; even the river mourns.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, your heart wears too many stones. Let us lift you from this water, I beg you, child.

Polonius (speaking)  
Ophelia, you must see how dangerous such attentions could turn. You are young and easily led astray.

I never sought his notice, nor encouraged him beyond common decency. Still, his affection seemed so sincere—I thought perhaps it could be real.
Polonius (speaking)

Are you fair?

Where is my father hidden? Will the willow show me? They say he lies cold, but I think I saw him in the bluebells, laughing.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Dearest Ophelia, your mind is weary—let me lead you to rest. Why do you sing such frightened, troubling songs?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Sing willow, willow, willow—the stream carries secrets sweeter than any pillow. My father’s beard grew roots, and now the fish all wear his eyes!
Claudius (speaking)  
Ophelia, what fantasy fills your heart? These riddles are sharp as needles—can you not speak plain?

Plain? Nothing is plain but pain! White sheets cover the world, and I hide beneath them with my songs.
Laertes (speaking)

Laertes (speaking)  
You must be cautious, sister. The prince’s will may be fleeting while yours is at peril.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I have tried to resist, but his letters and glances have found me; I am torn between joy and fear.
Polonius (speaking)  
Did he promise you anything—vows or intentions that I should know?
Ophelia (speaking)  
He has whispered promises, yes—love entwined with sorrow, as if he himself is lost.
Laertes (speaking)  
Let not your heart be led astray, Ophelia. You do not know what dangers may come from trusting him.
Ophelia (speaking)  
All I know is that I cannot erase his voice from my thoughts, nor his face from my dreams, and I am afraid of where this path may lead."
"compliant, resigned",Ophelia agrees to reject Hamlet and cut off contact after advice from Polonius and Laertes.,"Background: Ophelia agrees to reject Hamlet and cut off contact after advice from Polonius and Laertes.
Polonius (speaking)  
Ophelia, you must see that Hamlet’s words are but trifles, woven to snare your youthful heart.

Ophelia (speaking)  
I hear you both, and I will obey your counsel, though my heart is weary with the thought.
Polonius (speaking)  
It is wise, child. From this day forth, you must hold yourself apart from him, answer none of his letters nor grant him meeting.

Hamlet (speaking)  
You trouble yourself in vain, lady. My well-being is not your concern—nor ever was.
Ophelia (speaking)  
But you have given me such sweet words, filled my heart with hope. How can I not be concerned when you turn away so coldly?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Those words were wind, for the fool who listens. You had best forget them—and me.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Is this what you truly wish? For me to forget all the kindness and love that once passed between us?
Hamlet (speaking)  
There was no truth in your memory. Let it rot and fade, as all false things must.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Tell me then, what have I done to earn your scorn? Why do your eyes deny me now?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Go to a nunnery and trouble me no more. Your love is a poison, and I will not drink again.
Ophelia (speaking)  
If love is poison, then I have taken it all, for you have left me nothing else."

Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, you grieve too fiercely; you must rest. Put by these garlands and tell us your pain.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Bind violets with rue for remembrance; violets for thoughts, rue for regret—he loved me, but winter’s chill bites through the sweetest dreams.
Laertes (speaking)

Ophelia (speaking)  
It pains me, yet I understand your caution. I will return his letters unopened and speak no more with him.

Ophelia (speaking) What means your lordship?
Hamlet (speaking) That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
Ophelia (speaking) Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Hamlet (speaking) Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.
Ophelia (speaking) I did love you once.
Hamlet (speaking) You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it.

Ophelia (speaking)  
They buried him beneath the cold stones, but I think I hear him knocking, rattling the marrow in my bones. Do you see him, Gertrude? Does he stand at your elbow, or only at mine?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Sweet child, you tremble. Your father sleeps in peace; you must not conjure shadows that are not there.

No comfort remains in words, or in the brush of gentle hands—the water below calls me, cool and unjudging.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, do not walk further to the edge; your father and Hamlet would grieve for you beyond measure.  
Ophelia (speaking)  
Grief finds me, whether on land or beneath the glassy surface. What is left to love in this world where all I cherish is torn from me?  
Gertrude (speaking)  
We could rebuild—mourning is not the end, but the start of something new. Please, Ophelia, stay!  
Ophelia (speaking)  
My voice feels so small near the water, Gertrude. Listen—can you not hear it singing me away?  
Gertrude (speaking)  
I hear only your sorrow and the rush of the river. Come back, Ophelia, please—this pain will pass.  
Ophelia (speaking)  
For me, the world remains blurred beneath the surface; only there is it quiet.  
Gertrude (speaking)  
Stay, just one moment longer—reach for my hand, child.  
Ophelia (speaking)  
I am sorry, Gertrude, but the river knows my secrets and it beckons me home."
