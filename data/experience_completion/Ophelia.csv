grief-stricken and insane,"Overcome by her father’s death, Ophelia descends into madness and drowns in the river.","The great lord Polonius lies cold and breathless, and in the shattered hush of Elsinore’s garden, Ophelia drifts, her mind riven by grief’s cruel hand.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Father—where art thou gone? Your voice echoes under my ribs, yet your hands are frost, your lips silent as stone. My thoughts tangle, choking on your last word. Is love but this—a withering root drawn from the bank, a bloom drowned in shadow?
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, my sweet lady, look not so wild. The air is cool and thick with willow—I beg you, return with me, speak of what weighs on your pale lips.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I cannot come, madam, for my feet are heavy with mud and sorrow. There is a song that sings beneath my nails, scratching, and I cannot sleep for the tune. The river calls louder than your voice, and I hear my father’s cough between its reeds.  
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance. Pray, love, remember. And there is pansies; that’s for thoughts.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Wilt thou not heed me? The court is awash in whispers, and we would comfort thee, provide thee gentle ease.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Ease is a painted cloak, your majesty. I am unclothed, raw as bark, for all my dreams are torn. I am scattered seeds cast along the running stream—where is my father, to gather me whole?  
He has no grave in my sight, only mud and water and trembling reeds.  
How should I your true-love know  
From another one?  
By his cockle hat and staff,  
And his sandal shoon.
Horatio (speaking)  
Lady Ophelia—  
Speak not thus. There are those who love you dearly, who would bring balm to your wounds, if you would but let us near.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Love is a tattered wing—see how the crow laughs at fractured flight.  
You say “love,” but Hamlet gave me burning letters, words that blister. Have you seen my father’s eye, open in the dark, beseeching me without a tongue?  
They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
The king grieves for your father, Ophelia. Do not let your mind run untamed. Come back into the warmth.
Ophelia (speaking)  
The king? Ha! He weaves his hands in wool, but they are red, my lady—oh, so red.  
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window,  
To be your Valentine.  
My bones are no longer light. The brook hums and pulls, a cradle lined by green death. Would you have me return to stone halls, where the drapes are stained with cries?
Horatio (speaking)  
You are not alone. You must not think on these dark waters. The world turns still—would you let it turn without you?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Turn, turn. Let it wheel and grind, with me a spark on its rim, soon to be ash.  
I saw my father last night, Horatio, in my bed-blankets and at my shoulder. He reached and the reeds grew from his mouth.  
And will he not come again?  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead:  
Go to thy death-bed,  
He never will come again.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, you break my heart. Is there nothing we can do for you—no comfort or promise to mend you?
Ophelia (speaking)  
I am stitched with nettles, madam. My comfort is in the river’s hush, where minnows do not ask, nor willows judge.  
My legs are roots, my eyes are moons drowning in the tide. Will you not sing with me, or do you fear the cold as I do?
Horatio (speaking)  
The world will miss thy song if you vanish into silence, gentle lady. We cannot bear another chill upon our house. Stay; let us share the pain.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Pain is my comb, untangling the daylight until it snaps. Would you take it from me, Horatio, and keep my broken nights? My song splinters—its blood is on my fists.  
I will give you violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not say you will follow him, child. Your father would ache anew to see you thus, dashed upon the rocks of sorrow.
Ophelia (speaking)  
There are no rocks in the river, only arms—soft and winding, arms like my father’s once. He is cold and wants company; must I not answer his call?  
A thousand times good-night, sweet lords and ladies—may your lamps burn brighter than my hope.
Horatio (speaking)  
Ophelia, wait. The world can change, even for you. There are mornings yet unspoiled, moments yet untasted. The king will give what you desire—say but the word.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I desire nothing but absence, and even that tastes of mud. The king’s gifts are iron and my mouth is rusted shut.  
Do not follow me. Let me drift, petal-born, into the green embrace beneath the willow.  
And I will spread upon you flowers,  
And I will water them with my tears,  
And I will never return.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
She wanders into danger, Horatio. Send for help—her mind is undone.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The water licks my toes. Cold, cold—the first shock, like a mouth unkissed, like news of father’s death. The reeds bend, curtsy for a mad lady. Their green fingers tug at my dress.  
My hands full of weeds: forget-me-not and rue. My eyes upon the silver skin of the river—if I step, will I find him, waiting just below, his arms at last unclenched?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Here’s fennel for you, and columbines—may they sweeten the rot within. My father waits; he nestles with the lilies.  
O, woe is me,  
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Horatio (speaking)  
Take my hand, Ophelia. The water does not love; it devours. Let me bring you away, back to sunlight and voices human and warm.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Your hand is gentle, Horatio, but heavier than water. My grief drags heavier still. The roots know my name now. They whisper, “Ophelia”—how sweet on the tongue of moss.  
Daisies for innocence. I was once—no longer.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Is she singing, or weeping beneath the willow’s shroud?  
Hear her, Horatio—call the page, fetch the guard—
Ophelia (speaking)  
Snatches of song spin like wind in my throat. If grief is madness, let me be a breeze, a feather, a silver trout—anything but this aching flesh.  
Yet here I linger, tangled, water climbing up my ankles, my knees. I see my father, crowned in mud and blossom. He opens his arms—father, I come!
Horatio (speaking)  
No, Ophelia!
Ophelia (speaking)  
Good night, madam. Good night, dear Horatio.  
And all the pretty ones—where do they go? Down, down, to rest.  
The stream hums a lullaby. Farewell.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The world blurs: water in my ears, bloom at my brow. I go to my father, cradle-sunk. Petals close above. My body grows light as song—  
A hush, and then—nothing but the willow’s weeping."
confused and rejected,Ophelia is ordered by Hamlet to enter a nunnery and is told he does not love her.,"The background: Ophelia stands in the palace garden, her heart heavy as Hamlet has just commanded her coldly to seek sanctuary in a nunnery, denying her the love she believed she shared.
Ophelia (thinking)
How suddenly the warmth in his eyes has vanished— What crime have I committed to so estrange his heart? My chest aches as though my breath will not come, and yet I am rooted to this earth, unable to flee his words or presence.
Hamlet (speaking)
Get thee to a nunnery, Ophelia. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I myself am indifferent honest, yet I could accuse me of such things it were better my mother had not borne me. Go—thou art not safe among men.
Ophelia (speaking)
Yet only yester-day, thou didst press my hand and swear affection. Is all that thou spoke of, vanished now, like ice melted beneath my touch, gone with no trace?
Hamlet (speaking)
Ay, it is gone. Didst thou believe those words? Trust them as the grass trusts the dew? There is no certainty in such things. I did love thee once.
Ophelia (thinking)
A fissure cleaves through my mind—did he, then, ever truly love me? My hands claw at each other, seeking comfort. In the corners of my eyes, the world tilts, as if it could collapse around us.
Ophelia (speaking)
You say you loved me once; and now you cast me aside as if I were poison. Is this the fate of women, to be cherished and then dismissed, offered affection in hushed hours, then banished to solitude when it suits?
Hamlet (speaking)
Ophelia, thou must not believe voices that tell thee of constancy—within me is a tempest, a wolf spirit that devours all tenderness. My words were a folly born of illusions. Go thy ways, go to a nunnery.
Ophelia (thinking)
His voice is sharp; it flays. My limbs are numb, yet inside a hummingbird’s panic. Did I make him cruel, or did love simply wither because it was never true? Am I so unwanted?
Ophelia (speaking)
Tell me, Hamlet—do you cast me away to save me, or to wound me? Who in your mind am I now? Once, you called me bright hope.
Hamlet (speaking)
Thou art a foolish dream. In a world of rot and treachery, such hope is a child’s game. There is no warmth left in me to give. Go, before I drown us both.
Ophelia (speaking)
If you were to wound me, you have aimed true—my heart fails in its rhythm now. But if mercy moves you at all, speak plain. Was my love so laughable?
Hamlet (speaking)
There is no love, Ophelia. All men and women are but players, mouthing lines, believing what pleases us for an hour. Think not on me—or if you must, remember I have lost myself, and thee in turn.
Ophelia (thinking)
He speaks as though possessed, but I cannot disbelieve my own memory. The gentle evenings, the pressed hands, the laughter—how can such moments be only pretense? My tears burn, but I cannot let him see.
Ophelia (speaking)
To be told you never loved, and to believe it, is to rend open the world. Yet I do not know how not to love—even if I am made a fool by it. If I go to a nunnery, I go with a ruined soul.
Hamlet (speaking)
Better a ruined soul in holy walls than in the grinning jaws of men’s deceits. The world is unkind to purity and trust.
Ophelia (thinking)
My bones tremble. I wish to shout, to collapse, to vanish from his sight. But I am neither pure enough for a nunnery, nor strong enough to endure this scorn.
Ophelia (speaking)
And will you, Hamlet, find solace so easy? Do you not bleed, having cut me thus? Is all within you simply cold stone?
Hamlet (speaking)
Do not imagine I suffer less. But I bid thee go far, for my soul is rent—each moment we are joined, I become less myself and more a shadow. It must end here.
Ophelia (thinking)
He claims pain—does he know the shape it makes in my chest? Is there love in this banishment, however twisted? I search his face for some remnant of tenderness, but it is as if a mask has fallen into place, rendering his gaze strange and distant.
Ophelia (speaking)
If I were to go, would you remember me at all? Or would I become just another ghost threading your haunted halls?
Hamlet (speaking)
Memory is a curse, Ophelia. You will haunt me, aye, as every gentle thing haunts a man who has chosen thorns over roses.
Ophelia (thinking)
Is there reproach in his tone, or is it resignation? My own voice shakes, and my lips taste of salt. I wish I could hold him, mend him—but I am unfit, unwelcome.
Ophelia (speaking)
Farewell, then. What would you have me carry with me? Some token, or only your scorn? Give me a word, at least, to light the night of my exile.
Hamlet (speaking)
Take with thee nothing of mine. Forgive if you can—forget, if you dare. The world is a maze, and we two have lost our way within it.
Ophelia (thinking)
He gives me nothing, not even cruelty enough to anchor my anger. I am cut loose from him, from myself—a scrap of silk lost on the wind. My throat closes around words I cannot bear to speak.
Ophelia (speaking)
I will go, though each step will cost me blood. Will you at least believe that I loved you? Or has that, too, been blotted out, unworthy of mention?
Hamlet (speaking)
If you loved, then let it be a secret between you and your God. My heart is shuttered tight. Go, Ophelia—let there be no more words.
Ophelia (thinking)
He shuts me out. The garden’s hush presses in upon me, thick and suffocating. The sky, a wide pale ache, watches as I dwindle.
Ophelia (speaking)
Then all is silence. May some kindness find you, Hamlet, even when your own heart is lost to it.
Hamlet (speaking)
Kindness is for fools. I am past such things. Farewell, Ophelia.
Ophelia (thinking)
Farewell, indeed. My body refuses to move—these feet betray me, unwilling to carry me from the ruin of hope. Yet I must go, or else disintegrate beneath his scrutiny. The bench, the flowers, the stones—none pity. There is only the echo of absence, a shriek where his love once dwelt.
Ophelia (speaking)
I take my leave. If the walls of a nunnery shall not crush me, perhaps I shall yet find peace—or oblivion.
Hamlet (speaking)
Go. Let peace visit your dreams, if not your waking days.
Ophelia (thinking)
His voice pursues as I turn—final, implacable. Every step away is flint beneath my skin. There is no home left in this world. Hope—a thing so beautiful—has been strangled. I will walk until I am nothing or until sorrow relents its hold. I was Ophelia, beloved. Now, I am only Ophelia, forgotten.
Ophelia (speaking)
Goodbye, Hamlet.
Hamlet (speaking)
Goodbye.
Ophelia (thinking)
The garden sways; my heart cracks open, petals falling, never to rise again."
grief-stricken and mad,Ophelia loses her sanity and drowns herself after her father’s death.,"The background: Ophelia, fragile and adrift, loses her sanity and drowns herself after the death of her father.
Ophelia (thinking) The water sings a cold lullaby—soft as Father’s hand once upon my brow, sharp now where the light breaks upon its surface. Why do they all stare so? Shadows’ faces, pulling me downward, whispering. If I close my eyes, will I see him—Father? Or is he lost forever to me, as my name is lost to grief...
Gertrude (speaking) My dear, you wander through these halls with such a haunted gaze. Come here, Ophelia, let us speak, if only for a moment. What burdens you so that your eyes shine with tears instead of hope?
Ophelia (speaking) Hope, my lady? I scarcely know its color anymore. Did you not see the sprigs of rosemary at my feet? Remembrance, for love, which all the world now forgets. My father’s voice is ashes in my ears. The garden blurs into water. All the flowers weep.
Gertrude (speaking) You mustn’t speak in such riddles, child. The king grows restless, and Hamlet—oh, Hamlet’s mad as the sea. Can you not steady yourself, if only for your sake? For ours?
Ophelia (speaking) Hamlet once swore the world was brimmed with meaning—but his vows cracked underfoot like brittle leaves. He told me to a nunnery to go, yet who tends the lost hearts in their own cold cells? Is grief my only dowry? Must I court madness as my bridegroom?
Claudius (speaking) What is this? Another scene of wailing specters and haunted maids? Let us have done with mourning—it sours the court and stains the air with ghosts.
Ophelia (thinking) Ghosts? They tread heavy on my chest, invisible footsteps cracking the shell of my mind. Claudius’ voice grates like winter stones. He does not see Father’s blood, dried and unseen, on the roots of every tree.
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, the violets all withered when my father died. Faithfulness, so fleeting; is your heart not troubled by the turning of the river? By the hollow cry of the owl at dusk—by your own conscience?
Claudius (speaking) Enough! The girl is witless, raving at the edges of her wits, and our patience.
Ophelia (speaking) River, take my memory—wash it clean of this coil. My arms heavy as willows in the wind—ah, but will willows weep for me? My mind is tattered silk, each petal a sigh, slipping into the current. I cannot see for tears.
Gertrude (speaking) Ophelia, child, you tremble so—I beg you, come sit, let me hold your hands. This is but a passing storm, no wound beyond healing. The world cannot be so cruel as this.
Ophelia (speaking) Cruel? The world cracked at its keening. Motherless, fatherless, lover turned stranger—what is Ophelia, drifting on the tide? I gather baskets of rue for sorrow, daisies for warnings, and crowns of dead weeds. Would you wear them, my lady?
Gertrude (speaking) What talk is this of weeds and warnings? Your mind roams where I cannot follow—return to us, let us comfort you.
Ophelia (thinking) Comfort is a lie now, thin as frost curling on a pond. My feet press into the earth—a grave for hope. Hamlet’s promises ring hollow; Gertrude’s touch is nothingness swaddled in velvet. Father’s ghost crowds my vision, eyes like lanterns lost beneath the stream.
Laertes (speaking) Sister! I have only just returned, I found the road heavy with rumors. Why do you look so pale? Ophelia, speak sense to me.
Ophelia (speaking) Laertes! The hawthorn waits, the reeds sigh—brother, I have no sense left. My hands forget their work. Where is my father? Where is the comfort of your arms when all is wintered over?
Laertes (speaking) They have told me of your grief, but I never could believe it until now. My heart breaks to see you so undone. Come, let me hold you, let us mourn together.
Ophelia (speaking) Mourn? There are rivers enough for all our tears. I pluck grass-strings for garlands, weaving secrets for your grave, and mine. Sometimes I see Father in the rushes—he says nothing, only weeps. Should I go to him, Laertes? Should I follow the song that echoes so sweetly from the bottom?
Laertes (speaking) Sister, speak not so—your words chill me through. You are all that is left to me! We shall build a new morning from these ruins, I swear it.
Ophelia (thinking) Morning was Father’s voice; now it is the hush before drowning. My skin drinks chill from the riverbank—I ache to fade, to unmoor, to let my name slip from all lips, Ophelia, Ophelia, echoing into water.
Ophelia (speaking) My feet grow roots, deep and twisting. The wind hums—Father, do you hear? Will you meet me where the water runs black with forgetting? I am tired of starlight and sobbing, tired of flesh that binds me to sorrow.
Gertrude (speaking) Ophelia, come away from the door, the river is cruel tonight. Promise me—promise me you will stay.
Ophelia (speaking) To promise is to bind what is already broken, my lady. I wade out, one step after another—the water is cold, but gentler than hands that would hold me for the wrong reasons. I loved and was unmade by such love.
Laertes (speaking) No, Ophelia! Do not leave—do not let Father’s death steal you from me as well!
Ophelia (thinking) The water’s arms curl around me—like childhood dreams, like sleep I cannot recall. The stones call my name in bubbles. The light is rippled and strange.
Ophelia (speaking) When I was small, I sang to the silver minnows—they darted and flashed, never listening, always vanishing. No one listens now, Laertes, not even you. Mother gone, Father murdered, Hamlet changed—I once knew a lullaby to mend broken mornings, but the words are as lost as I am.
Laertes (speaking) I beg you, step back. Let me help—let me save you!
Ophelia (thinking) Save me? No man can mend that which the world has unstitched. The water is a womb and a grave—tempting, final, silent. My limbs untangle, heavy, relieved.
Ophelia (speaking) The violets wither, the rosemary too. I lay down my garland, white as a winding sheet. Remember me as a flower pressed beneath a stone, forgotten in the reeds.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not go—hold fast, my girl! We can begin again—surely love is not so frail.
Ophelia (speaking) I am so small against the current, so tired. Father, I come—if only the water will bear me on. The world narrows to ripples, hush, cool darkness, a song only I can hear.
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia! No! Help! Someone—she is in the stream—Ophelia!
Ophelia (thinking) The crying fades. The world softens. Father, where are you? If I close my eyes, will it hurt? Is grief only heavy until I let go? The sun breaks, scattered in the water, shining through my fingers, then lost. All is softness, all is floating.
Ophelia (speaking) Goodnight, sweet prince, sweet father, sweet sorrow. Bind up my heart in the river’s cold cradle. No one will remember. No one must remember. There is peace in this forgetting—the water closes over.
Gertrude (speaking) All is lost… poor daughter, wreathed in waterlilies, her voice no more.
Laertes (speaking) Sister! My soul is torn in two—curse this world that buried hope!
Ophelia (thinking) Cold, sweet, quiet, and gone. I drift into the hush—grief, memory, pain, all left on the shore. Father, I am coming home."
