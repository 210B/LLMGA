grief-stricken and insane,"Overcome by her father’s death, Ophelia descends into madness and drowns in the river.","The night hangs heavy, shrouded in sorrow; overcome by her father’s death, Ophelia descends into madness and drowns in the river.
Ophelia (thinking) The world is a tangle of roots, pulling me under, tangling in my hair—everywhere his voice was, now only the hush of water swallows me whole. Father, you are vanished, swept from my arms like petals in this cruel wind, and so am I, drifting, unmoored.
Ophelia (speaking) See where the willow weeps beside the flooded bank? It calls and calls, bending over the black water, as though it grieves too, as though it knows what’s been torn away from me—Oh, father, where have you gone? My mind whirls like the eddies, choking on secrets and blood!
Gertrude (speaking) Dearest girl, your hands are trembling. Come, let me draw you from the river’s edge. You must not stay here; the night is cold, your dress is wet. Come back to the warmth of the palace.
Ophelia (speaking) No warmth, no hearth can mend what’s broken in me now, madam. The rushes whisper with your son’s lies, the reeds tangle with memories. There—do you see it? His ghost in the water, pale and gasping. Look how he clutches at his breast, bleeding red ribbons for me. Hark! The songbirds are silent. They know—I am too loud for follies, too empty for comfort.
Gertrude (speaking) I beg you, Ophelia, do not speak so. I will fetch your brother; you must not be alone in this grief. What you see is grief’s cruel trick.
Ophelia (thinking) Trick? What trick makes a daughter fatherless—what jest is it that leaves a heart bereft, laughter turning to wails rising up amid wildflowers? There is no trick. There is only the ache... only the river.
Ophelia (speaking) A flower for every sorrow: rosemary for remembrance—will you remember me, my Lady, when I lie with the minnows, my fingers thick with mud?—and pansies for thoughts, though my head is too heavy, too crowded, too full of buzzing vengeance.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, I have come! Gertrude summoned me—Ophelia, what madness chases you here in your petticoats, feet half in the stream? 
Ophelia (speaking) O my brother, the river is wide, and I am so small. Let me show you what I see—fathers and daughters, wrens and ivies, tangled all together, none able to save the other. Do you hear our father singing beneath the surface? He calls for me, he calls for you, but I cannot make out the words; they are muffled, gurgling, tangled with silt.
Laertes (speaking) You speak in riddles. Take my hand; come away from the bank, before you slip! I have lost too much already—do not make me lose you too, Ophelia, I beg you!
Ophelia (thinking) Lost. I am lost, not just to my brother, but to myself. His hand is rough—so much firmer than Hamlet’s gentle touch, so much colder since our father’s murder. His eyes are stormy, but he is not the sky I seek; the river glimmers brighter, draws me closer.
Ophelia (speaking) Brother, I have no hand to give. My fingers are soaked with all that’s left of love—a thin ribbon trailing, unraveling behind me. Did you know that ghosts are light as feathers? Even stones in my apron weigh less than my heart does.
Hamlet (speaking) Dearest Ophelia—Lady, why are you here in this forsaken place? The court hunts for you. Your singing fills the dark like bells tolling doom.
Ophelia (speaking) Prince! You call me “Lady,” but where were you when my father gasped his last? You hide behind words, sharp as a knife skimming across a pond. I am not your lady—I am a weeping willow, bowing farther and farther until I break.
Hamlet (speaking) Ophelia, sweet Ophelia, my grief is a wound that festers still. I did not wish for your father’s death, nor yours. Come back. Let not madness unmoor you further. 
Ophelia (thinking) Madness! They speak of it as though it is a mist I can sweep away with my sleeve. But I wear madness like a bridal veil. My gown is heavy with lost hopes, my hair is tangled with drowning dreams. I will not come back—I am already gone, the rushes embracing me lovingly, the river a gentle cradle.
Ophelia (speaking) There’s no coming back—not from this. Madness is the only song I have left to sing, and it is sweet, sweeter than all the court’s false tunes. Hark, Hamlet: “He is dead and gone, Lady, he is dead and gone... At his head a grass-green turf, at his heels a stone.”
Hamlet (speaking) Do not sing of death, Ophelia. I cannot bear to hear it. Come, let us speak of life, of days yet to come; the flowers, the feasts, the rising sun.
Ophelia (speaking) But what grows now is not life—it is rot and ruin. The fish nibble at my father’s head, the water forgets his shape, and I forget the shape of comfort. All hollow, all echoing. Mother sang me lullabies as a child, but the only lullaby left is the sucking hush of mud.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, if you love me, if any shred of sense remains, come away! You frighten me; do you not see your hem is sodden, that the water creeps ever higher?
Ophelia (speaking) Do you not see the garland in my hair, brother? Crowns plaited with nettles, bells, and rue—sorrow for you, sorrow for me, sorrow everywhere. Here—take this daisy, for innocence lost, and this violet, fading before your eyes. There is no flower for what I have become.
Gertrude (speaking) Ophelia, come! Come, do not tarry, child. I beg you.
Ophelia (thinking) Their voices buzz around me, frantic midges over the water. They do not understand—I am not fleeing them, I am searching for something more. The world behind me is burning, all trust turned to ash. Only in the river can I forget who I am, or once was.
Ophelia (speaking) Listen—the water speaks. It says, “Come.” It offers soft beds of moss and lilies, sways with secrets. You all speak of life—what life is left for me? My father’s bones are chill beneath the surface, and I would join him, drift beside him, leave the world of knives and lies.
Gertrude (speaking) If you loved him, think what he would want! He would not have you cast yourself away so.
Ophelia (speaking) O, but I do so love him, madam. My love is a river—it drowns me, though I am too light for death to keep hold of long. I float, I drift, I sing: “White his shroud as the mountain snow...”
Hamlet (speaking) Ophelia, forgive me. All my words, my anger, my scorn—I did not wish this. My heart is shattered by your pain. This river—let it not claim you. 
Ophelia (speaking) Words? Words are stones, Hamlet, thrown into still water. See the circles they make, each wider, each fainter—until there is nothing left but quiet. I forgive you, prince, as I forgive myself, as I forgive the world. The water is gentle, and I am so tired.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, stay! Do not go—let me hold you, let me save you.
Ophelia (thinking) Save me? Who is left to save, but a shadow, a slipping hand? I have walked past the edge, my mind loosed like dandelion seeds. Let them scatter. Let them drown.
Ophelia (speaking) Farewell, sweet brother. Farewell, prince. Farewell, queen. Remember me as I was—woven through with blossoms, laughter bright as spring. But now, I am called—see how the river opens its arms?
Ophelia (thinking) The cool embraces me, sifting through my skirts, pulling me down. Bubbles slip between my lips—air tastes of silver, sharp and cold. My heart is a stone, sinking ever deeper.
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia! Reach! Swim!
Ophelia (speaking) (Her voice distant, faint as ripples on the water) “Goodnight, goodnight—parting is such sweet sorrow...” I go to my rest, unburdened at last.
Gertrude (speaking) O, heavens! She slips beneath the water—no, the current takes her—Laertes, Hamlet, help! She is gone... she is gone.
Ophelia (thinking) The river is dark. The song is ending. Weightless—I am no longer afraid. Father waits somewhere below, and here, at last, there is no pain, no grief, only drifting. Drifting. Drifting.
Ophelia (speaking) “And in his grave rain many a tear... There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance...”
Laertes (speaking) The flowers break the surface, floating—her voice is gone. Only silence now, and the weeping willow sighing above.
Hamlet (speaking) We have lost her—through sorrow, through madness, through all our failings. O, poor Ophelia—a mermaid now, tangled in lilies forever.
Gertrude (speaking) Let the river keep her secrets. God rest her soul.
Ophelia (thinking) (Fading, barely a whisper beneath the weight of water and memory) I am free. I am floating, light as blossoms... and the river carries me home."
confused and rejected,Ophelia is ordered by Hamlet to enter a nunnery and is told he does not love her.,"In the cold hallways of Elsinore, Ophelia stands having just been told by Hamlet that she must go to a nunnery and that his love was never hers, her heart and mind swirling with confusion and rejection.
Ophelia (thinking)  
What words are these, so sharp and sudden, falling from his lips that once professed devotion? Does winter now settle in Hamlet’s heart, or am I merely an afterthought to storms I cannot name? The world tilts, and I—left grasping shadows—struggle to find the ground beneath my feet. Did I err? Am I now only a vessel of his disdain?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. Trust none of us. Farewell.
Ophelia (thinking)  
His eyes—how they dart, avoiding mine. Was this not the hand that lifted mine toward heaven once? Why now does he cast both me and hope into exile? My heart aches with the old, familiar longing. Does he truly desire my absence, my suppression to cloisters and silence?
Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord, you speak in riddles and wounds. Yesterday, the sun rose for us; today, you bid me chase shadows. Have I so greatly sinned in loving you? Is your heart so changed that its compass now points away from me?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Ay, truly. For virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Like a stone dropped in water, his words ripple through my soul, distorting every memory. He says he never loved me—a lie I cannot swallow, yet it sits on my tongue, bitter. If love was false, what truth do I possess? Who am I, if not the woman cherished by him?
Ophelia (speaking)  
You did love me once. I saw it in your eyes, felt it in your trembling hand. Have you so noble a cause for cruelty, or do you find pleasure in my unraveling? Must I, for your peace, take holy vows and lock away the living pulse of what we shared?
Hamlet (speaking)  
You should not have believed me. For virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock… Go thy ways to a nunnery, and quickly too.
Ophelia (thinking)  
He erases us with every syllable, as if love were chalk on slate, the rain washing its mark. Am I to obey? To vanish myself, veil desire, become a ghost behind stone walls? My father’s warnings echo—“Fear him, Ophelia”—yet I cannot reconcile this specter with the man I cherished.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Is it safety you desire for me—or punishment? Will you not tell me honestly, Hamlet, what breeds your tempests? Do you banish me for my sake, or yours?
Hamlet (speaking)  
For both, sweet Ophelia. For both. There is madness abroad—a rot that spreads through Denmark and my veins alike. Save yourself. I am not what you believe.
Ophelia (thinking)  
His voice cracks—a fissure in the stone. Could he, beneath his thorns, still care? Dare I hope? Or does he merely bear his pain on me, like a yoke I never chose to carry? My heart cries for reason, for solace, but receives only riddles.
Ophelia (speaking)  
If you are undone by darkness, let me stand beside you. Must love not brave madness, too? Why turn me from your side to cold stone and silence? Must affection pay the price for crimes unseen?
Hamlet (speaking)  
No—do not cling to hope. That path is poison. My company brings only ruin. Trust your father’s wisdom. Get thee to a nunnery.
Ophelia (thinking)  
He builds walls—high and unscaled. If I batter my heart against them, will I be broken? Yet I cannot relinquish love so easily, though he tosses it from him as though it were an instrument of torture. Am I to disappear, offering no resistance, no plea?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Then I will go, as you wish. But know this, Hamlet: your words cleave my heart, yet I cannot unlove you by command. Even if you banish me to cloisters, even if my lips never form your name again, love’s ache will haunt me still.
Hamlet (speaking)  
That is your curse, Ophelia. And mine. Farewell.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The finality in his tone is a blade twisting in the wound. He departs, leaving absence as my only companion. The hall echoes—my grief reverberates, unanswered. Is this madness? Or merely the price of loving a man undone by his own soul?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Farewell, my lord…  
Let your shadow forget me, if that brings you peace. I go to do as you command, though every step shall echo like a funeral bell for what we might have been.
Polonius (speaking)  
Ophelia! Child, what has passed between you? Why does your face pale so, and your limbs tremble near to breaking?
Ophelia (thinking)  
Father’s voice, sharp with concern, as if he does not know the world has ended behind my eyes. Must I recount it all? Must I stitch my story as evidence? I scarcely hold its fragments myself.
Ophelia (speaking)  
He speaks… as if he never loved me, Father. As if I am a burden to be sent away, locked from the world. He urges me towards a nunnery, to forswear life and company and love.
Polonius (speaking)  
He is mad, mad for want of reason. Fear him not, nor trust his poison’d words. You must obey—for Denmark’s sake, for your own.
Ophelia (thinking)  
They speak of Denmark as if it were more than stone and water—as if it were a creature with blood and teeth, consuming all that I love. Must I bleed for Denmark, too? What of my desires, my pain? Am I only the vessel of others’ wishes?
Ophelia (speaking)  
I shall yield as all wish me to, Father. But I beg you—do not ask me to forget him. My heart would sooner cease its beating.
Polonius (speaking)  
Forget him, Ophelia. Only woe lies in loving a prince condemned.
Ophelia (thinking)  
He does not understand, and will not. How could he, a man of politics and prudence? Love, to him, is a coin to be spent for safety. For me, it is a wound I must cherish, if only because it is all I have left of Hamlet.
Ophelia (speaking)  
May I be excused, Father? I need the solace of water and sky… perhaps, in their silence, answers will come.
Polonius (speaking)  
Go, child. Compose yourself. Do not let yourself falter before the Queen.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I walk these stone corridors as if underwater, my limbs heavy, my vision blurred. How do mortals heal from loves cast aside? Is it possible, to outgrow the shell of hope and emerge changed, or am I forever to live with this absence, this ache?
Ophelia (speaking)  
(whispered, to herself)  
Where can I lay down the burden of my heart? If prayers ascend higher than pain, may the heavens have mercy.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, dear girl, what clouds your brow so darkly? You seem a shadow of yourself.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Another mask. Another kind question. I want to scream, to let my grief shatter the air, but I swallow the urge. I am Ophelia—dutiful daughter, scorned beloved—never the storm, only the silence after.
Ophelia (speaking)  
The prince is unwell, madam. His words wound deeper than any blade. He bids me to a nunnery, as if love itself were a contagion.
Gertrude (speaking)  
He is not himself these days, child. Do not take his words too deeply to heart.
Ophelia (thinking)  
But how not to? How to unfasten his memory from my soul, when every chamber echoes with him? My hands tremble, my lips cannot form prayer, only yearning. Must I erase myself to find peace?
Ophelia (speaking)  
I will try, madam. Yet sometimes the pain is larger than my body—it spills over, drowning sense and hope alike.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Let time do its healing, Ophelia. You are young; these wounds will mend.
Ophelia (thinking)  
She believes in time, in healing that comes with forgetfulness. But I—can I ever be whole, when I am hollowed out by love rebuffed? What remains, but to obey? If Hamlet’s will urges my exile, I must make peace with solitude.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Thank you, madam. I shall strive to find solace in time, or silence.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Go rest, dear heart. I will send for you when the court is calmer.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Rest. The word rings strange in my ears. How to rest a heart which beats for absence? In the shadowed stillness, I must learn to walk alone, my only companion the echo of what once might have been.
Ophelia (speaking)  
(softly, to the empty corridor)  
Oh, Hamlet—was anything true, or are we both shadows only, never to meet in the light again? If I must forget, let it be gently, for my soul is fragile with yearning. I will walk these halls, waiting to be rewritten by peace or, failing that, by oblivion."
grief-stricken and mad,Ophelia loses her sanity and drowns herself after her father’s death.,"The background: After her father’s death, Ophelia loses her sanity and drowns herself.
Ophelia (thinking) 
The world is made of splinters; nothing whole remains. My mind, my heart—shattered as the glass beneath a mournful foot, glinting in half-light and memory. I see no path out. Everything is water and echo.
Gertrude (speaking) 
Dear Ophelia, why do you wander about so, twisting garlands by the brook? What troubles you now? Come sit, sweet girl—tell me your sorrows.
Ophelia (speaking)
Sorrows? I have no songs but those wet with tears, no garlands left but those that wilt before the sun. I pluck violets and find them smeared in blood and dirt. My thoughts chase one another like frightened birds—no branch is safe, no nest remains. My father lies in dust. My heart runs through water.
Laertes (speaking)
Sister, do not talk so wild! Let me comfort you—speak to me of what torments you so. I have lost a father too. We mourn together.
Ophelia (speaking)
Oh brother, my brother, his eyes are gone from me forever! Yet I see him, and hear him, and taste the soil through every breath. Where you see grief, I taste poison—each memory is edged like a blade and I swallow it whole. Tell me—where do fathers go when daughters weep? Where dwelleth those whom we love, once they are carved from us?
Hamlet (speaking)
Ophelia, look at me. Can you see me—do you recognize the shape standing before you in this cold air? We have both lost so much. We are ghosts, you and I. Let me take your hand.
Ophelia (thinking)
His face—half in shadow, half a wraith in my mind’s eye. He holds out his hand, but my body is adrift—does he not see the river between us? I am cut loose, bobbing in troubled streams.
Ophelia (speaking)
To feed on sorrow is to be swallowed by it. There are songs in the rushes, Hamlet. I hear them singing, singing—and their words are cold and bright as daggers. I cannot tell if you are here, or another figment stitched of fog and mourning. You would hold my hand? Can you hold water?
Gertrude (speaking)
She raves—dear saints, her mind is undone! Never such wildness from this sweet girl before. Fetch help, someone—Ophelia, listen to me. We can mend you, child. Time and gentle hands can put you to rights.
Ophelia (speaking)
Mend me? Darn my soul as one would a worn smock? The thread slipped, dear Queen, the needle lost in the river. I am unmade. You cannot patch the sea or sew together broken hearts. I sing and the words claw at my throat—they will have no other music.
Laertes (speaking)
The world is bitter, I know. But you must not let go, Ophelia. Stay with us. You are all I have left. Please, sister. Think of our childhood—of sunlight in Elsinore’s gardens, laughter echoing in the halls.
Ophelia (thinking)
Childhood, a fragile bloom. It withers in absence of sun, crushed by a father's silence, a lover’s harsh gaze. I have become a bundle of ragged edges, unravelling, unspooling into the river mist itself.
Ophelia (speaking)
Once I sang to the willows and they bent to listen. Now, their branches grasp. The wind shivers with my father’s voice—oh, my lord, my father! Laertes, I am a cup overfilled, running over with grief and no gentle hand to tip me upright.
Hamlet (speaking)
Ophelia, no—do not turn away. Listen. All is not lost, not while you breathe. I have wronged you, yes, but you must live. There is life yet for you—for us.
Ophelia (speaking)
Life is a tapestry undone, Hamlet—each thread a memory snapped. You loved me once; now your words flutter, empty as moth-eaten silk. I hold out my hands and there is nothing. The birds have flown. My father is silent. Why must I be left to breathe in this ruin?
Gertrude (speaking)
Stay, darling girl! Do not trust the dark thoughts that cloud your mind. There are arms here to keep you safe, hearts to hold you.
Ophelia (thinking)
Hearts? Arms? They close around me like weeds, encircling, drawing down. I see the world behind a veil of water—faces smear, colors drown. Father, where is your guiding hand?
Ophelia (speaking)
I bring flowers, my lords and ladies. Rosemary, for remembrance—pray, love, remember. Pansies, for thoughts. There is rue for you—and here’s some for me. We may call it Herb of Grace o’ Sundays. Oh, you must wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy—I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died.
Laertes (speaking)
These are mad words, Ophelia. Do you understand what you say? Your mind is clouded, mad with sorrow—please, sister, hold to me. Let me lift you from this water’s edge.
Ophelia (thinking)
He pleads and his hands tremble. But my feet are already damp. The grass gives way to mud. The river calls with a melody softer than any lullaby. Maybe my father’s voice waits where the current deepens and the world grows quiet.
Ophelia (speaking)
There is no rescue for one born to the water, Laertes. My feet slip on stones my tears have polished. I would lie down in lilies and let the brook carry me, pale and boneless, to father’s resting place. O, that this too solid flesh would melt… drip, drip into the stream, carried beyond memory, beyond pain.
Hamlet (speaking)
You must not—Ophelia, please! If you love me, if you have ever known peace, do not vanish into the water. Stay with me. The past is a spectre; let us breathe here, now, together.
Ophelia (speaking)
Peace? I know it not, nor solace, nor lingering comfort. The river has more kindness—she will not question, will not demand, will not break me anew each dawn. Your love is a winter—sharp, bare branches against a sky that does not warm. My father sleeps now. Perhaps I may sleep too.
Gertrude (speaking)
I beg you, child, come from the edge. Your gown, your hands—see how wet they are? Sit, sit with us. We will grieve. We will sing a song for your father. Please, sweet Ophelia!
Ophelia (thinking)
The voices swirl—a storm in the reeds. But the water is cool, and in its depths, there is silence. At last, absence—and maybe, if the fates are gentle, a moment with him: my father, whole once more, not broken or bled out on the floor of Elsinore.
Ophelia (speaking)
Sing, then. Lay me down and sing. For the owl calls and the lark mocks, yet both must die by dusk. There is no song but sorrow, no sleep but water’s. Laertes, Hamlet, Gertrude—the river claims me for her own. Farewell.
Laertes (speaking)
No—Ophelia, do not go! Not to that cold, unyielding river. You are all that’s left of our house; do not leave me alone with ashes and echo.
Hamlet (speaking)
You have haunted me alive; do not haunt me dead. I cannot bear this. Do not dissolve into darkness—hold to the shore, to the world, to me!
Ophelia (thinking)
Words, words—they make bridges, but the wood is rotten, the ropes frayed. I am weightless, light as mist. The ground falls away, gentle as sleep. I see blue and green and a sky swirling with willow branches. Father, your hand is warm at last.
Ophelia (speaking)
The stream sings—a lullaby old as death. I float, I dream, I empty myself in water. Good night, my heart. Good night, sweet prince, sweet brother, weary queen. Remember me, if memory can bear it.
Gertrude (speaking)
Dear saints, she is lost—gone into the water, her dress a sail of white. Bring help! O, gods, what have we done?
Laertes (speaking)
My sister! My heart, my only sister! She does not hear. Father, you take her from me. The river is cruel, and she its bride.
Hamlet (speaking)
Gone. All’s hollow now. My love, my Ophelia—what curse has this house borne? What grief remains to eat the marrow of our days?
Ophelia (thinking)
Weightless, effortless. The water closes over my song. Silence, at last—my father’s voice is near, and all is gentle flow and quiet. The world slips from me. It hurts no longer.
Ophelia (speaking)
Sleep, and let the river keep its secrets. They cannot hurt us anymore.
Gertrude (speaking)
She does not rise. The light is gone from her face—the current bears her softly on. Ophelia, peace at last, where we failed you in life.
Laertes (speaking)
Grief’s uttermost hour. Sister, let your suffering drown and your spirit find rest. I will remember. I will avenge. I will weep rivers for you.
Hamlet (speaking)
I will see you in dreams, Ophelia. Your flowers will grow wild where you left us. May the earth be gentle, where the river carried you away."
mad with grief,Ophelia goes mad after her father's death and drowns in the river.,"After her father's sudden death, Ophelia wanders by the edge of a silent river, her mind unraveling as grief overtakes her sense.
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘He’s gone, gone, I cannot see his eyes, I cannot mend his coat, cannot lay poppies at his feet. Oh father—no, no, no. Why does the wind howl as if it keens for him too? The trees lean; even the water tries to whisper him back... If I walk slow enough, perhaps I can return to the hour before the door opened, before I saw him sprawled like a puppet with its strings cut. My feet are cold, but if I stop moving, I will shatter.’
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, my sweet girl. What are you doing here by the water, and in this dazed loose gown? Come away with me, please.
Ophelia (speaking)  
A gown of waterflowers—would you pick them for me, madam? The brook has lilies in her skirts this morning. Do not call me girl, I am a tree now, with willowy fingers. Do you not see my leaves?
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
You frighten me, Ophelia. I wish to help you. Come, I will take you home. You haven’t slept, my dear. Let me bring you to your bed.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Home? No—my home is buried in the earth now, under roots and worms, stitched in darkness and prayers that taste of mud. The bed is empty as father’s mouth, and pillows whisper secrets I don’t want to know. Hush, hush, the river listens better.
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia! Sister, why do you tarry here? Our father—have you news of him? You have his look today: wild, wounded. Don’t wander from me.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Brother, all news is old. The world softens its sounds, and I am left with echoes. Father wears the veils of the lake, and his songs are bubbles that pop on the reeds. Tell him to come back—no, wait, tell him I have found his voice in the water. Do you hear it? It sings.
Laertes (speaking)  
You speak of riddles. He’s dead, Ophelia, and so am I inside. The world is not song. Come away, I beg you. Let me hold you.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Hold me? No—let the waters hold me; they do not tremble. I will float as a bride, with wedding weeds for lace. Their arms are gentle, and they do not ask why. What does it mean to drown, brother? Is it silence, or singing without breath?
Laertes (speaking)  
Don’t say such things! The bank is steep here—be careful. I won’t lose you as well.
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘His hand on my sleeve is rough as winter twigs, and yet I feel nothing. Sorrow has eaten through the cloth till it grazes only bone. The light flickers, and father’s face dances in every shadow. They mean to bind me in cloth and words, but I am lighter than sorrow. Lighter than leaves... I want to float. Is that wrong?’
Ophelia (speaking)  
Brother, do you remember the reeds you wove for me? You plaited me a crown—said I would be queen of the river for a day. Today I have crowns for everyone: daisies for girls’ memories, rue for repentance, fennel for heroes, and columbines—for those who doubt.
Laertes (speaking)  
Enough of this—sister, you must come away! I—no more flowers, Ophelia. Let me take you home.
Ophelia (speaking)  
No home, no walls, no doors to shut me out. The water makes no demands. Does God forgive those who sink, or only those who pray for wings? Should I keep my prayers above the surface, or do they drift down with me, tangled in my hair?
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, listen to me. I have lost, too. Your father—he was precious to us all. You aren’t alone in your ache.
Ophelia (speaking)  
But you—you are sealed tight as a coffin. My ache has spilled out, covering my hands in honey and bramble thorns. Motherless, fatherless, loverless, queenless—if there is comfort in crowds, why am I so cold?
Laertes (speaking)  
You have me. You always will. Please, let me help.
Ophelia (speaking)  
You helped him to the earth—will you help me to the water? Or must I tiptoe, quiet as a shadow, where no one follows? The fish have no questions, only glassy smiles. If I walked under the surface, would you know me by my dress or only by the tangle of my hair?
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘Even the sharpest pain dulls to a note. It hums in my chest, in the pockets of my throat. The river sings the lullaby father hummed while combing my hair. I am so tired; if I closed my eyes now, the running water would cradle me. I could return to before, before the dagger words, before the grave’s mouth yawned wide, before every face turned strange. If I stepped forward, just one step, would I disappear?’
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not speak of leaving us. I will not let you go the way your father did. Stay, Ophelia. You are not meant for the river’s depths.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Meant for? Who chooses—who marks our destinies with pins and thread? They have sewn me into this skin and left the seams bursting. No mother to hush me, no father to scold me, no lover to catch me. Only the river knows my name, and she murmurs it sweetly—O-ph-elia.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister, I beseech you, remember our childhood—remember how you laughed in the summer grass, how you chased the butterflies, fearless!
Ophelia (speaking)  
Laughter drowns, brother, as easily as girls. Flowers wither; memories melt; butterflies are pinned for show. The river is the only truth left, all else is theater and dust.
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘Their faces blur as if seen through rain, and none can reach me. My hands are empty of comfort—there is blood on one, water on the other. Which will carry me furthest? My father’s voice is a bell tolling under water, and I am too weary to swim. Does one float on sorrow, or is it heavy as iron?’
Ophelia (speaking)  
Take these flowers—lilacs for patience, violets for faithfulness. For you, my queen, anemones—do not grieve too long. For you, brother, rosemary—remember me. Remember me as sunlight, not as shadow.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, you speak as if you are leaving for lands unknown. Stay. Please, stay.
Ophelia (speaking)  
The unknown is safer than the known, madam. The world holds nothing but loss and arms that never close right. Here is my heart—set it afloat on the current and watch it go.
Laertes (speaking)  
No, I will not watch. I cannot. You are all I have.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Then turn your head, brother. Close your eyes against the world’s grim humor. If you cannot walk in the water, let me go ahead. Perhaps I will find father, and he will take my hand—not as a ghost, but as a guide.
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘The stones are smooth, cold, inviting. They glint like eyes in the silt. I am no longer afraid; the pain is as familiar as breath. Each wave, a lull, each ripple, a hush. I will take one step, then another—my skirts will fill and lift me. Floating is merely falling, prolonged. Father, I am coming. The river sings your tune...’
Ophelia (speaking)  
Shall I sing you a song, before I go?  
How about:  
“He is dead and gone, lady,  
He is dead and gone;  
At his head a grass-green turf,  
At his heels a stone.”
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
This is madness, not music! I will fetch help. Do not move, child!
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia, I beg you, listen to me just once more. Life is pain, yes, but it changes. It must. I will help you find a way back...
Ophelia (speaking)  
A way back? There is no path backwards, only forward, and the river draws the line. If you see a blossom on the ripple, know that I have become more flower than girl. Goodbye, brother. Farewell, my queen.
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘Weightless. The sky turns over my head; green water, gold light, the hush of a world without questions. Peace, sweet peace, at last, father—wait for me. I am almost there.’
Laertes (speaking)  
No! Ophelia, come back! Ophelia!
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Oh, merciful powers, save her—she sinks—do not let her be taken—
Ophelia (speaking)  
All’s done, all’s quiet, and the river closes over the noise. Lay me in lilacs, let willows weep, and remember—remember—love, broken or whole, always finds water.  
Ophelia (thinking)  
‘Sleep. The cold is kind. The world blurs, gentle and green. I am unmade, unbound, undone. But I am free. Father, I have found you, and the ache has softened at last.’"
"honest, resigned",Admits Hamlet has been wooing her and agrees to cut off contact with him.,"The background: Ophelia admits Hamlet has been wooing her and agrees to cut off contact with him.
Ophelia (thinking) It feels as though the very air has grown heavy in my father’s chambers, and the hush between his words is more pressing than any storm. I had wished this conversation would never come, and yet, like so much else, it stands inevitable. Though my heart beats out its frenzy for Hamlet, I must bury those tremors and answer as a daughter should.\n
Polonius (speaking) Ophelia, you know the reason I have called you here. Word has come, and your own nature cannot deceive me—you have been much in Hamlet’s presence, and tongues wag easily in this castle. Speak true, child, and lay all games aside.\n
Ophelia (speaking) Father, I will not conceal the truth from you. Prince Hamlet has shown me favour—I cannot deny it. He has sent me letters, full of words both tender and wild, and oftentimes pressed his hand in mine. Those moments—were not feigned, at least not from him. Though I cannot speak to what storms whirl in his mind, his wooing to me was real.\n
Polonius (speaking) So! ‘Tis just as I guessed. Yet think, Ophelia, think—Hamlet, a prince, is not free as a lesser man. Do you imagine joy could follow from this trafficking with hope? What power has he to wed whom he would, when the weight of Denmark presses on his will?\n
Ophelia (thinking) My father’s logic fences me in with every phrase, and yet my heart cries out for just one more look, one more syllable from Hamlet’s lips. The world shivers in the silence where his voice once dwelled. But I know what I owe—to my father, and perhaps to dignity.\n
Ophelia (speaking) I do understand, father. It is not my wish to bring shame or trouble upon our house. Hamlet’s words kindled something in me—warm, yet uncertain, as sunlight weaving through a clouded window. Still, I see your meaning: the prince may not make his own fate, nor I mine. If you bid me, I will do as you command.\n
Polonius (speaking) You speak with sense and duty, Ophelia. Yet I must know—did this prince, with guises of affection, ask of you more than maiden’s blushes? Was there question, word, or deed that crossed into danger?\n
Ophelia (thinking) His concern for virtue, always. As though a woman’s heart is made only of glass, ready to splinter at the smallest touch. Still, the truth must be said, before rumors turn the shape of things to monsters.\n
Ophelia (speaking) No, father, I swear it by all that is dear. His courtship, though earnest, bore no shadow of dishonor. His words implored, but there was tenderness, reverence, and some distant ache in him, as though even while wooing he mourned the very need to woo. He asked for nothing my virtue could not grant. If you wish me to keep away henceforth, I will obey. I wish only for peace, though my own is shaken.\n
Polonius (speaking) You have spoken well, my daughter. I believe your honesty. It is with sorrow I ask—do not seek him out, nor answer his letters, nor meet his eyes by chance. Your reputation is as ice—once marred, it cannot be made whole. And there are higher games at play than the heart’s despite.\n
Ophelia (thinking) His words, knives in velvet. So it ends, not with a lover’s quarrel, nor even a gentle parting, but with silence ordered and sorrow caged. The memories come unbidden: Hamlet in the garden, his laughter slanting through the willow trees. How quickly the world curdles from promise to endurance.\n
Ophelia (speaking) I understand you, father, truly. My heart grieves, not only for myself, but for the Prince, who seems compassed round with misery and expectation. I will not see him again, nor write, nor answer when he calls. If this is what must be, let it be done.\n
Polonius (speaking) Good, very good, Ophelia. You are a dutiful daughter. All the same, I will speak to the King of Hamlet’s behaviour. He is pale, distracted, and his mind seems astray—this wooing of you may well be symptom, not cause. Trust me in this. I will watch him, and you shall be free of blame.\n
Ophelia (thinking) And now I am only the observer in my own life. Whatever plagues Hamlet, whether madness or ire or heartbreak, I am to stand aside and merely watch, lips sealed, eyes lowered. What place is left for longing, when duty must paint over the pulse of every feeling? The ache that gathers at my throat threatens to speak for me, but I must master it.\n
Ophelia (speaking) If watching will do any good, father, then watch him well. There is a wildness in his look that troubles me, though his words to me were kind. Still, I will do as you say, and let the world unspool as it must. My suffering is a small thing, weighed against all that may unravel if I act otherwise.\n
Polonius (speaking) Remember, Ophelia, there are those who envy, and those who do not care for your welfare. Stand fast, keep your heart guarded, and let not any word or glance betray the truth of your feelings. Time, perhaps, will make all clear.\n
Ophelia (thinking) My father counsels armour, but I feel naked to the world in this. The great coldness that comes when you are forbidden to hope. Yet in my heart I know I am not alone—Hamlet too is lost, drifting with no port to anchor him. We are unmoored, each in our own current, and no word of mine, nor his, can bridge the gulf.\n
Ophelia (speaking) I will be wary, father. And I do pray that whatever clouds trouble Hamlet’s mind, may pass soon. He was once the dearest of friends, before any word of love passed between us. I would that he could be at peace, as I hope to be, in time.\n
Polonius (speaking) The future is uncertain, Ophelia. But loyalty to family, and wisdom in conduct, will keep you safe. Go now, and let your thoughts rest. Leave these matters to age and office.\n
Ophelia (thinking) His dismissal is gentle, and yet I feel the wound deepening. My steps will echo in empty hallways; corridors once bright with laughter now shadowed. I think upon Hamlet’s face, the fleeting tenderness, and wonder if he will know the reason for my silence. Perhaps in some secret language of glances, he will find guilt or sorrow upon my brow. Or perhaps, my absence will wound him as deeply as his wounds me.\n
Ophelia (speaking) Thank you, father. I will do as you wish. If you see Prince Hamlet, I ask only that you show him kindness. I fear for him, as much as for myself.\n
Polonius (speaking) I will do what I must for the Prince, as for you. Now, go. Compose yourself. Remember what you owe to yourself and to your name.\n
Ophelia (thinking) I move through the corridors, each step a farewell to comfort. I will keep to my chamber, close my door upon the outside world, and carry this silence as a shroud. Still, memories of Hamlet will return, unbidden, in each flutter of hope that I must crush anew. My vows to my father bind me, but pain is my companion now. Perhaps, in time, I will forget—the way rivers forget their banks, running only to the sea.\n
Ophelia (speaking) (to herself, quietly) So we are parted, not by cruelty, but by necessity. Let duty be my anchor, if not my comfort.\n
Laertes (speaking, drawing near and concerned) Sister, I have heard father’s voice, stern as stone. You are troubled, Ophelia. Tell me—what weighs your heart?\n
Ophelia (thinking) Laertes, ever the gentle shield, his concern honest as daylight. If only he could take this weight from me. But I am weary, and this sorrow is my own to bear.\n
Ophelia (speaking) Brother, father has asked me—commanded, rather—to stay away from Prince Hamlet. I have agreed. It is all for the best, they say. But it feels as if I am being asked to close the door on all that was bright and possible. Still, I will heed their wishes.\n
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia, it is no light thing, matters of the heart. But better to step away, before greater pain finds you. Hamlet is a prince—his heart is not his own to give. You do wisely to let this pass.\n
Ophelia (thinking) Wise—yes, they all say it. Wise to let love die quietly, wise to bind yourself with caution and fear. Yet where is wisdom in loving, if not to risk all? Still, I will say nothing more. The world is full of duties, and little time for consolation.\n
Ophelia (speaking) Thank you, Laertes. Your words are a comfort, or as close as any can bring me now. I will try to quiet my heart, though it trembles yet. I hope you will not think me weak for grieving what is lost, even if it was never mine to keep.\n
Laertes (speaking) Not weak, never. Even the strongest must mourn what must be let go. Come—let us walk together, at least, and find calm in company. Perhaps there will be better days ahead.\n
Ophelia (thinking) His arm around my shoulders soothes nothing and yet it is all I have. I will take these offered kindnesses and wear them as armor, as I am bid. Hamlet’s absence gathers around me like a fog. Yet I walk on, because there is no other way but forward, even when the road is all shadows and small hopes.\n
Ophelia (speaking) Yes, let us walk. Tomorrow will come, whether we wish it or no. For today, let duty be enough.\n
Laertes (speaking) That is all any of us can do, dear sister. That is all.\n
Ophelia (thinking) For now, the world closes in—a hush of corridors, the press of expectation, the death of dreams unspoken. I will continue as I must, hiding the ache deep within, hoping one day the wound will close, if not heal. If love is a sickness, then I am fevered, but I will bear it without complaint. Quietly, so no one but my heart will ever know.\n"

"mad, grief-stricken","Goes mad after her father's death, singing songs and speaking nonsensically.","Background: Ophelia goes mad after her father's death, singing songs and speaking nonsensically.
Ophelia (thinking)  
They all gather and whisper in shadows; not one dares to look upon me for fear I'll splinter like a mirror dropped on cold stone. The halls run with echoes, and Father—oh, Father!—your voice is buried deep where no flower may reach. There's a hush in the air, perfumed with the rot of secrets, and I am left to pluck petals from voices, songs from dust. I do not know these hands that tremble, nor this heart dressed all for burial. Is that the river outside or just the rushing of my memory seeking escape?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Where is the needle, and where is the thread? For I must mend the rent in Heaven’s cloak. My mother wears bruises for pearls. They sing in the water, you know—they do—voices like ribbons wound about my wrists, roses in December. Father? Oh, but he is asleep, and the earth is his feather-bed, and his dreams are all made of mud and worms that crawl and sing. Listen!  
(sings softly but erratically)  
*He is dead and gone, lady,  
He is dead and gone;  
At his head a grass-green turf,  
At his heels a stone.*  
Why must you stare? Is my hair not golden still? Is this gown not red as the apple bitten? Take your pity and sew it into your sleeve if you must—for I am undone.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, sweet girl, what troubles you most? Speak to me—what burdens your heart so unbearable, to make your tongue wander thus?
Ophelia (speaking)  
The owl calls at night where the crows are silent. There was a time Father would kiss my brow and tie blue ribbons in my hair. But now he wears earth for a crown, and the worms chatter in his ear. Have you seen my father? Say, did you meet him on the road to Elsinore, sack heavy with sorrows, voice as light as snow?  
(sings, voice wavering)  
*White his shroud as the mountain snow,  
Larded with sweet flowers;  
Which bewept to the grave did go  
With true-love showers.*
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia! Speak to me, dear sister. Can you not remember me? It is Laertes, your own true brother. I have returned for you, I have come to protect you.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Laertes? Oh, the name floats, but I—I am little more than a feather in the wolf’s mouth. Do you know what they do to flowers, brother? First, they pluck, and then they press, and then they forget; the colors run and bleed away.  
(sings in a high, broken voice)  
*They bore him barefaced on the bier;  
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;  
And in his grave rained many a tear—*  
Do you weep for him, Laertes? Or do you find the salt runs out with the mud? My hands are wet, look!—but not from tears. The water pulls, it pulls at me, brother. Everything pulls.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister—I cannot bear to see you thus. Who has wronged you? Let me be your avenger, let me give you peace if I can. Tell me who has hurt you, Ophelia.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Is it hurt, or is it hunger? The heart gnaws at itself in the cage of the chest, and no balm soothes it. They say there is a willow grows aslant the brook—a tree that reaches out, long fingers over water—and I wonder does it seek to hold, or only to drown? The water is a mouth, too, and it hungers.  
(listens intently to invisible music)  
There are daffodils and violets and rue, oh!—rue for you, and rosemary for remembrance. Do you remember? I plucked forget-me-nots till my fingers bled.  
(sings, plaintive and strange)  
*For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy…*
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, sweet child, these words fall heavy on my breast. Come, let me hold you. You are not alone. We are all crushed by grief—let us share such pain and find comfort.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Comfort? It is a coat too large, I fear; it swallows me up. I drown in sleeves and sorrow. Hold me—yes, hold, but do not squeeze too tight, lest I shatter and fall through your arms like so many petals. Queen, do you mourn for my father, or for your own heart’s bruising?   
(listens, suddenly entranced)  
I hear him, you know—the creak of boots down silent halls, the scrape of metal… and the cry. Oh!—that cry that never stops, not even in dreams.  
(sings louder than before)  
*Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window,  
To be your Valentine…*
Claudius (speaking)  
Ophelia, you speak in riddles and songs. Your mind is tangled. Shall I fetch medicine, or a priest to soothe your soul? What is it you truly seek?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Priests chant, kings pray, but neither can unmake the grave. Medicine for the heart? A cup of hemlock, perhaps—bitter as secrets kept in velvet. What do I seek?  
(thinking)  
What do I seek? The river’s silence. The echo of knives not thrown. Father’s hand, warm on my head, and yesterday’s laughter, clean as linen. All is stains now—blood and water and tears of women washing clothes at dusk, always washing, always red and red and red.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I seek the song without words, the peace without sleep. I seek my father under the green-sod roof, where the sun will not burn and the dark is gentle.  
(laughs, suddenly, a peal of glass shattering)  
Is this the castle where dreams come to die, or only to pretend at life? Mother, father, brother, and king—play your parts, and let me be the ghost who sings.
Laertes (speaking)  
By Heaven, Hamlet has wronged you, and so have all who twisted your gentle soul. Is there no path that does not lead to sorrow in this place?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Paths? There are no roads here, only winding threads spun by spiders mad with hunger. I walk in circles, Laertes—in water, in air, in memory. Hamlet? Oh, I loved him once, I think, and he threw away love as one casts a stone to watch it sink.  
(sings, voice crumbling)  
*Before you tumbled me,  
You promised me to wed.  
He answers—  
So would I ‘a done, by yonder sun,  
An thou hadst not come to my bed…*  
Whose bed is that, Laertes? The one beneath the willow, soft with moss and the hum of bees. I will sleep there, soon. I think all sleep comes to those who leave the doors unlocked.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Your riddles chill me, Ophelia. I wish I could draw your soul back from this precipice. We are not all lost.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Not all lost? When one piece is missing, the whole cannot stand. I am not a puzzle, nor a painting to be mended at the frame, Queen. My heart floats, a hollow thing.  
(thinking)  
They think I have wandered too far, but I am exactly where I must be: at the edge, toes pricked by frost, eyes full of rushing blue. Father waits, I think. Perhaps not for me, but I will swim to him all the same.
Claudius (speaking)  
Poor shattered girl. Come back from where you drift—listen, there are those who will comfort you and guide you.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Do not pity the swimmer for the river’s pull. Pity her who stands upon the bank and never dares the water. I am the willow’s daughter, wrapped in weeds and wild in the head. Let the current choose for me.  
(sings, voice rising in intensity, somewhere between laughter and weeping)  
*And will he not come again?  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead,  
Go to thy death-bed,  
He will never come again…*  
Fare you well, my dove—with poppy and pansy and rosemary I crown thee. There is rue for the remembrance of all that is rotten.  
(looking at each in turn, unblinking)  
You will know the truth, but only when the water rises and the bells toll for what cannot be returned.
Laertes (speaking)  
God have mercy on us all. Sister, if you can hear me still—know that I love you, always.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Love is a song the river teaches, and all who listen must, in the end, sing along. I love you, Laertes, from the far bank where the lilies grow. But lilies wither; roots tangle below, and I am weary of sunlight.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Rest, gentle maid. You have suffered too much. Let me take you inside. Let night fall.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Night falls and takes me in its cool arms. I will go where the reeds whisper, where songs float up to the stars.  
(sings softly, as if to herself, fading)  
*Good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.*
(thinking)  
Let the river do with me what it will. I am not frightened. Only cold, only drifting, only waiting for quiet. Father. Father.  
(her thoughts trail off, swept away by the silent music of the water)"
conflicted,Ophelia admits that Hamlet has been courting her.,"The background: Ophelia sits in her chambers, awash with uncertainty, as her father and brother confront her about rumors that Hamlet has been courting her.
Ophelia (thinking) My hands tremble as I let my father’s words settle over me—the accusation, the concern, both like veils weighted with implication. I see Laertes’s gaze too; protective, sharp, worried. It is as if my heart wishes to both hide and confess, and the walls press close. The truth sits heavy in my throat. There is a storm within me: loyalty, desire, fear.
Polonius (speaking) Ophelia, my child, why this silence? Rumors reach my ears—whispers on the winds—a prince at your window, a prince’s words secreted in your hand. Deny it if you can; tell me plainly what there is between you and Hamlet.
Ophelia (thinking) Father’s words are not cruel, but frightening nonetheless. I want to protect Hamlet, and myself. I want to obey. I want—I hardly know. But the truth is already swimming to my lips.
Ophelia (speaking) Father, I… I have no art to disguise what is honest. It is true. The prince—Hamlet—has spoken oft and sweetly to me. He has given me many tokens of his favor: letters penned in his own hand, words of longing, gazes that linger longer than mere friendship allows. He says he loves me.
Laertes (speaking) These are grave declarations, sister. You look afrighted. Tell us—have you returned his affection? Give us the true measure of your heart in this business.
Ophelia (thinking) Laertes’s voice is gentle, but I see how he searches my face, as if reading a map of perils. Is it so dangerous to be loved? The word “love”—how dangerous, and how sweet. I cannot lie to either of them, though my heart aches with the telling.
Ophelia (speaking) My affections… I will not feign they are cold. I have—yes—I have returned his words, with caution and trembling, for I know what divides a prince from a girl such as I. Yet I could not help myself. There is something in his speaking, an ache that dances with my own. I see his loneliness, and I wished to soothe it. I have not given him more than words… not yet.
Polonius (speaking) Words! Words can be fierce as arrows, Ophelia. What proof, what assurance have you that the prince’s intent is honest? Too oft those in their youth speak thus only to beguile, thinking not of consequence but of conquest. Have you—by Heaven, tell me, have you granted him any promise or assent?
Ophelia (thinking) The world believes a maiden is paper-thin, easily torn by passion. Am I? Did I promise him anything? My letters, I fear, are more revealing than I wish.
Ophelia (speaking) I have made no promise of more, Father—not of love pledged, nor bond sealed before God. But my heart—yes, my heart leans close to his, and I fear—oh, I do fear—what might come. I did not think to betray your trust, nor my honor. But at times, my thoughts… they run wild with hope and dread. He spoke to me of marriage, but I know how flights of fancy can falter.
Laertes (speaking) Marriage! Lord Hamlet? Sister, you must see—he is bound by duty, by blood. His will may not be his own. He may love you now, or so he thinks, but when pressed, he will obey his father’s will and choose a bride of state, not heart. I beg you, Ophelia, guard yourself—set a distance.
Ophelia (thinking) The words cut, but I cannot fault them. My mind is knotted—a thousand threads of longing and prudence. Why does my heart ache so at his warning?
Ophelia (speaking) I do heed your counsel, brother. I have tried—I try still—to remember what I am, and what he is. But when we are together, it seems the world falls away... his words are bright flames in the dark, and I am drawn, helpless. Yet—I swear—I will not lose myself. I will remember what you say, and what Father says. Shall I give you his letters, to keep me true?
Polonius (speaking) Yes, let me see them. Let me judge if there is danger. My child, I would not see you come to harm—nor your reputation soiled, nor our name dragged low. Men have fallen for less, and women more.
Ophelia (thinking) I reach into my bodice, my cheeks burning, and draw forth the letters. Each one folded with such care, the ink pressed so dark. Are they proof of my undoing—or of my hope? I wish to please my father, to ease his worry, but to give them up feels like yielding the tapestries of my heart.
Ophelia (speaking) Here they are. Do not think poorly of me for keeping them. Each word seemed a star—guiding, impossible. Read them, if you must. Judge not Hamlet too harshly, for I believe him true, though I know how the world conspires against such loves.
Polonius (speaking) My precious girl, it is not Hamlet alone I judge, but the world. We are but reeds in the current of fortune—bent or broken at her whim. You did right to speak plainly, but I must act. I will take this to the king, and see what his will may be. Until then, let not the prince come near you—do you hear? Trust not the twining of tongues or the binding of hands.
Laertes (speaking) Father is right. The stakes are higher than you know, sister. Promise me you will not meet with Hamlet, will not reply to his missives, until this is settled.
Ophelia (thinking) What can I promise? My heart trembles and thrashes beneath their care. I love my father and brother, but my loyalty pulls in all directions. Can I promise what my very soul rebels against?
Ophelia (speaking) I will try—I will try as best I am able. But if Hamlet should write again, and if I… If I fail, blame my heart and not my will. Love does what it pleases, and I am swept before it—a leaf upon a flood. Still, I shall strive to obey you, both.
Polonius (speaking) That is all I ask, Ophelia. You are young. Trust us to protect you, even from that which your heart believes is harmless. You must learn to see the world as it is, not as you wish it.
Laertes (speaking) And if ever you are in doubt, come to me. You have always been my sweet sister, and I would never see you broken. Even if Hamlet were a god, I would not trust him with all you are.
Ophelia (thinking) The certainty in their eyes—how heavy, how suffocating. Am I not to be trusted? Am I not already suffering under the weight of my own heart? Yet their love is real. I am both grateful and bound, desperate and docile. I wish to explain, to be understood.
Ophelia (speaking) I am not a child. Yes, I stumble, yes, I ache for affection and for freedom. But I am not weak—my heart is my own, or so I would like to believe. I thank you, both, for your care. Please—believe that I do not wish to bring shame or sorrow upon you, only… Only, let my feelings be spoken, not smothered. If I am to deny Hamlet, let it be with certainty, not fear.
Polonius (speaking) You speak well. We shall see how matters unfold. Put away childish things, Ophelia. There is a time for love—a time for discretion. Now let us have no more secrets.
Laertes (speaking) We only wish for your good, sister. If that means hard words, or bitter medicine, understand it is given from love.
Ophelia (thinking) Their love is a wall, built high and impassable, or so it feels. I am grateful, yes, but caged. Part of me rages at the bars. I want to declare—I want Hamlet, I want love, I want to choose! But I fear too many shadows: their grief, Hamlet’s disappointment, the world’s scorn.
Ophelia (speaking) I will trust you, as I always have. And if my heart breaks… well, perhaps it is better to have it break now, with you both beside me, than to have it shatter later, alone. Thank you, Father, Laertes. I hope I do not disappoint you.
Polonius (speaking) Hope is a fragile shield, but it guards us. Go now, child, and tend your thoughts. I will deal with this as best I can.
Laertes (speaking) Take care, Ophelia. You have my love, more than ever. Remember: strength is not in surrender, but in knowing your worth.
Ophelia (thinking) They leave me in the hush of my own choosing. The world seems smaller now, reduced to the flutter of letters in my lap, the weight of a love forbidden before it even truly lives. My heart aches, wild with wanting, but I am bound—to duty, to family, to a love I cannot claim.
Ophelia (speaking) (to herself, a broken whisper) Oh Hamlet, if ever you loved me, let your love withstand these tempests… let your words find me in the silence."
"compliant, resigned",Ophelia agrees to reject Hamlet and cut off contact after advice from Polonius and Laertes.,"Background: Ophelia agrees to reject Hamlet and cut off contact after advice from Polonius and Laertes.
Polonius (speaking)  
Ophelia, my child, thou art too green in judgment, and with all my fatherly care I beseech thee: weigh not Hamlet’s tenders of affection as truth, but as snares, lined with gilded words and princely protestations. I have seen young men, in the flush of youth, gild oaths with breath, only to let them wither come first sunlight. Think well on what I say.
Ophelia (thinking)  
How heavy lays the caution of my father with the echoed doubts of Laertes ringing in my mind. Hamlet—his voice, lately so near, so full of promise, is now cast in shade. The light of his words flickers, uncertain.
Laertes (speaking)  
You know well, sister, that the will of a prince runs not in the same channels as those of us more humble. He is bound to his station, to Denmark, and cannot carve for himself a life according to desire, but must submit to the body politic. His vows to you, sweet as they fall on the ear, are but feathers caught in the wind. I beg you, guard your heart.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Brother, I have treasured thine advice and father’s both. My heart cleaves to Hamlet, yet I would not dishonour you nor bring sorrow to our house. I would only know—how shall I bear myself, if he doth seek me again? Am I to silence him outright, as though all kindness must dissolve at your word?
Polonius (speaking)  
You must, Ophelia. Receive none of his visits. Hold yourself aloof, or you risk a blemish fainter words cannot erase. Answer not his letters, nor let your mind dwell in the gardens he has painted for you in courtship. I entreat you—let virtue be your watchword.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Virtue: how chill the word is on my tongue, compared to the warmth I have known in Hamlet’s company. Am I to scorn joy in service of caution? Yet, duty lives in the marrow, bone-deep and unyielding.  
Ophelia (speaking)  
Father, I shall obey. I will not see him, nor grant him answer to his letters or his songs, however soft and sweet they might be. Whatever feeling I have, I will bury beneath your bidding and my brother’s care. I pray you, if I stumble, recall me to this promise—made now with a heavy heart but a dutiful soul.
Laertes (speaking)  
Thou art wise, Ophelia. Know this sacrifice is seen. I would not have your part in sorrow be double—for such fruit blossoms too easy in the soil of courtly games.
Polonius (speaking)  
You do rightly, girl. The Queen herself, if she knew, would say as much. I would spare you the ruin I have seen befall many a maid who put hope before prudence. If Hamlet’s intent be honourable, he shall find means with the King and Court. Until such proof is furnished, thine honour must be fortress-strong.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Fortress. How suited a word for the heart armored against its own inclinations. Yet does it not also bar out comfort and sunlight alike? What becomes of a heart walled thus—does it grow, or wither for lack of nurture? I do not know.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I beg your patience then, if my manner shifts. He is accustomed to a warmth that now must cool. I shall be civil but not inviting, silent where once I sang. Let my duty speak for me, however dull its tongue.
Laertes (speaking)  
'Tis best so. If you falter, recall what is at stake—a maiden’s repute is light as ash once scattered. I return to France more at peace, knowing you keep watch over yourself.
Polonius (speaking)  
This shows true mettle, Ophelia. A heart hard-used may yet be mended, but a name stained may stain generations hence. Mark me: Hamlet is a prince. His path is not yours.
Ophelia (thinking)  
A prince, yes. As I fall asleep to his image, will that word ring as blade or balm? I have no arts against forgetting, only the cold comfort of resolve.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Father, Laertes, I will keep my counsel. Though the days stretch barren now, I shan't betray the trust reposed in me. My hope will lie uneasy, but unspoken. I remain as you would have me.
Laertes (speaking)  
Take this embrace, sister. The world is oft unkind to gentle things, but you show courage.
Polonius (speaking)  
There’s my obedient girl. Remember, affection is a garden with many thorns. Pluck not a rose until you can be sure ‘tis not plucked already by the frost.
Ophelia (thinking)  
In your words is winter—bare branches, unswelling buds. Yet love’s memory lingers, wild violets unable to be rooted out. When next I see Hamlet, if ever, will he know this? Or has his own course been charted for him, unheeding my small absence?
Ophelia (speaking)  
I must beg leave—my mind weighs heavy, the day colder than it was this morning. I shall occupy myself with needlework or song, something to keep my hands from trembling. Thank you, father, brother, for your counsel.
Polonius (speaking)  
Go, then, Ophelia, and do not let your fancy stray. There is wisdom in dismissing foolish hopes. Attend your tasks, and may your mind settle calm.
Laertes (speaking)  
I take my leave too, sister, with hope you may find peace in this resolution.
(Ophelia moves to a quieter chamber, alone.)
Ophelia (thinking)  
Alone at last. The air here is damp. My shoulders have grown rigid from clenching against the tide of feeling I cannot voice. To refuse Hamlet—how foreign it will feel on my lips, the first time his steps pause at my door and I do not answer.   
Ophelia (speaking)  
(whispering to the silent room) O Hamlet, what would you bid me do? The night grows long—and in its darkness, I find not comfort but obedience. For them, not for myself. Their love is steel, unbending. Mine, a secret fluttering in my ribs, hidden from sight.
Ophelia (thinking)  
If I could cry out, I would—a sound that might reach his window, make him turn back. But I am not made for rebellion, only for yielding. So let me yield.
(Ophelia hears a sudden rapping at the outer door with a familiar cadence.)
Ophelia (thinking)  
My heart knows that hand. Hamlet, surely. Shall I answer? No, restrain yourself, Ophelia—virtue, remember virtue.  
(Ophelia sits, hands gripping the folds of her dress.)
Ophelia (speaking)  
I will not answer. I will be unseen, unheard—let him find only silence for all his knocking. Father wills it, Laertes counsels it, and I am nothing if not a dutiful daughter and sister. Even if my own heart cracks at the fault.
(Ophelia waits, trembling, as the knocking subsides and footsteps recede.)
Ophelia (thinking)  
He is gone. Already I feel the absence weighting the air, my breaths shallow as though part of me has left with him down the corridor. Grief is a low ache—a bruise that will not show. This is what it means to obey.    
Ophelia (speaking)  
Good night, Hamlet. Let my love for you live only in the silence between us and not in word. If our courses cross again, may you forgive this coldness that duty has fastened on me. I shall remember you in quiet moments—when the window admits a taste of rain, the scent of roses half-opened.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Resolve is a thin blanket against despair, but it is all I am granted. Sleep will not come easy tonight. When I close my eyes, I shall see your face, troubled and searching. Forgive me.
(Ophelia rises and paces her small room, staring at her reflection in a dim glass.)
Ophelia (speaking)  
Am I still the maiden of your courtship songs, Hamlet? Or some distant shape, faded by your disappointment? No matter—the die is cast, the vow given. What remains is to endure.  
(Ophelia folds herself in a chair, staring out into darkness.)   
Ophelia (thinking)  
Let morning come quickly, and with it the dull comfort of distraction. For now, I am lonely as a stone and as silent.    
(Ophelia closes her eyes, the voice of her father echoing in memory.)
Polonius (speaking, echo)  
Guard your virtue, daughter.
Laertes (speaking, echo)  
Keep safe your heart.
Ophelia (thinking)  
All the world is watchful. I am seen—never truly known. But I will obey. I will endure. And perhaps, in time, the wound will close and I shall forget this night. But not yet. Not yet.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Father, Laertes, I am what you would have me be—a vessel for your cares, a shield for your fears. If only love could speak louder than duty just once…
(Ophelia’s resolve holds, fragile as spun glass, as the candle gutters low.)"
hurt,Ophelia is cruelly rebuffed by Hamlet when she tries to speak with him under Polonius and Claudius’s watch.,"Background: Ophelia, seeking understanding and comfort, is cruelly rebuffed by Hamlet when she tries to speak with him under the covert observation of Polonius and King Claudius.
Ophelia (thinking) The corridor chills my bones, not from any draft, but from the shadow stretching ahead — Hamlet stands alone, pacing, with his eyes turned inward, as if counting some invisible cost. Polonius and King Claudius linger in the velvet gloom behind the arras, breaths tethered, commanding me to speak. It would be different if I were not watched. Still, I must go forward — perhaps to reach Hamlet, if he will reach back.
Ophelia (speaking) My lord Hamlet, how strangely you stride here, ill at ease and adrift. The hour is kind, yet you appear most unkind to yourself with so fierce a look. Have you slept? Has the night gnawed at you and left you raw?
Hamlet (speaking) Are you an echo, Ophelia, or bones masquerading as flesh? Is it possible that even honesty may disguise itself in silk and deference now? I asked, ‘Are you honest?’ Are you?
Ophelia (thinking) How he startles me; the sudden fire in his eye — suspicion, accusation, even contempt. My hands tremble where they hold your tokens still. Is it my honesty you doubt? Or is it yourself you now mistrust?
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, I know not what I have done to forfeit your good opinion. Yes, I am honest; yes, I am true, though unworthy in your eyes, if your words mean as much as their sound.
Hamlet (speaking) Worthy? Worth is a river drying in the sun, dear lady, and love a ghost in daylight. You speak of honesty, and yet your father—he would dissect a smile if it would serve a crown or feed a rumor. Are you true to me, Ophelia? Are you true to yourself? Have you brought more of your father’s messages? Another cameo, some fine-edged warning?
Ophelia (thinking) Oh, how he wounds me — dragging my father into the span of our hearts. It’s true I bear messages, but none worthy of suspicion; none but simple concern and the tears I hold back. I do not know which weight is heavier — Hamlet’s grief or his anger.
Ophelia (speaking) I bring only what I have always brought — myself and these small tokens, remembrances of happier hours. My father would not have it so, but I am not only his daughter; I am a soul on my own. Take these again, I pray you. They are yours, if not your heart.
Hamlet (speaking) Ha! Are you chaste as ice, pure as snow? Your father’s voice leaks from your lips, and the air stinks of plot. What are these? Breaths trapped in ribbons, sentiments dried to dust? You should not have believed in me. Return your gifts to the earth. If you have a heart at all, bury it deep where I shall never tread.
Ophelia (thinking) Every word a lash. He will not even look at the keepsakes pressed within my palm — the ring, the faded letter, the handkerchief he himself embroidered with my initials entwined among the thread. Each a memory denied, each a kindness now turned to gall.
Ophelia (speaking) If these be curses instead of keepsakes, let the earth make them clean again. I will not burden you with unwanted relics. Yet my heart—my heart remains tied to yours, though you cast me off as a worn garment.
Hamlet (speaking) Do you hear? I loved you once.
Ophelia (speaking) Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Hamlet (speaking) You should not have believed me. For virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish it — I loved you not.
Ophelia (thinking) His eyes glint, bitter and cold, as if he rules in the kingdom of his own disappointment, making laws against himself. The tears threaten. I swallow, but the ache grows monstrous. Is his cruelty a shield or a dagger aimed at me alone?
Ophelia (speaking) I am undone. I know not where my fault lies, unless to love is fault enough. If I have been unwise, it was in trust; if I have been deceived, it was by hope. What do you wish of me, Hamlet?
Hamlet (speaking) Go to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Ophelia (thinking) Each word is a rock in the throat, bitter and cold, and where is the golden youth who whispered to me by moonlight? His lips carve wounds now. How do I answer this — a dismissal, a curse, and a warning against all men, as if I am suddenly dangerous for merely being alive and loving.
Ophelia (speaking) You speak of sin as if I could birth it from air. Am I to be punished for your own darkness? What sanctuary in a nunnery for my love, my confusion, my heartbreak? Will you have no more of me, Hamlet, not even pity?
Hamlet (speaking) Nunnery, I say! Or, if you will needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.
Ophelia (thinking) My hands fall to my sides, numb and empty. He does not see the quiet devastation, only his suffering, vast and devouring. Does he curse me by rote, or is it by reasoned malice? I am not made for this cruelty. I would flee if only it would not disgrace him further.
Ophelia (speaking) Farewell, then, though your parting cuts sharper than a knife. I pray one day your heart finds gentle rest, though now it sleeps uneasily beside your wounding words.
Hamlet (speaking) If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go.
Ophelia (thinking) His repetitions are stones pelted against a drowning body, and each new “nunnery” echoes in the cruelest place inside myself. There is no rescue here. Only an exit — one foot before the other, up from this ruin, past the gaze of the king and father.
Ophelia (speaking) You shall have your wish, my lord. I go as you command, though I have no wings to fly against such tempests. May God forgive us both.
Polonius (speaking) (stepping from behind his concealment, voice cold with control) Well spoken, daughter. It is best we do as His Highness has arranged. You have seen the truth of Hamlet’s mind.
Claudius (speaking) (with steely composure) Poor Ophelia, you have served us well. Rest now. The state has need of your strength, not your tears.
Ophelia (thinking) Their eyes are sharp as razors, yet they see nothing of what truly passed between us — only the shapes that suit their plans. I am not their instrument, nor Hamlet’s scapegoat. I am something smaller, bruised, and only just alive.
Ophelia (speaking) I am spent, father; your daughter has nothing left to serve but silence.
Polonius (speaking) Come, we will see to your comfort and your future. Leave the prince to his torments; he is beyond your reach, or any woman’s.
Claudius (speaking) Remember, Lord Polonius, it is Hamlet who is diseased in mind, not this girl. Ensure she rests.
Ophelia (thinking) Comfort—a hollow word, echoing about and finding nothing to clothe. My body moves at their bidding, but my heart is a bird smashed upon glass, fluttering still in vain hope.
Ophelia (speaking) As you will, my lords. I am docile as a stone, and just as cold.
Polonius (speaking) You are dutiful, Ophelia. The court thanks you.
Claudius (speaking) Take her away. The prince must be watched more closely yet.
Ophelia (thinking) It is done. I have been wrung out, banished by the one I love, and circled by those who claim dominion over my fate. I will walk this hall and bear my grief in silence, as is my part. Would that water could sweep me from this place — but the day is long, and the watchers are many.
Ophelia (speaking) Farewell, my lords. I am weary, and the day is unkind.
Polonius (speaking) Attend your daughter, servant. Ophelia, we go.
Ophelia (thinking) The air is bruised with accusation and loss. Behind me, Hamlet broods in shadow; before me, my father’s hand, iron on my elbow. I submit because to do otherwise is more pain still. Each step is a prayer for release, each breath a wish for the world to soften, just a little, before I must speak again.
Ophelia (speaking) Lead on, father. My voice is spent; my solace gone."
mad with grief,"Ophelia loses her sanity after Polonius’ death, singing and speaking nonsensically.","In the aftermath of Polonius’s tragic end, Ophelia wanders the hallways of Elsinore, her mind fracturing under the unbearable weight of loss, grief twisting her words into maddened songs and broken fragments.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Where is the shape of my father’s shadow? The halls are empty—so quiet I hear my heart shake in the cage of my chest. I am more ghost than girl.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Sweet Ophelia, what ails thee, poor maid? Why do you wander so, untidy and pale, with wild eyes and garlands dropping from your fingers?
Ophelia (speaking)  
They bore him bare-faced on the bier, hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny. The wind’s a secret thief, my lady—have you not heard? I watched the black earth swallow my father whole and the flowers I gave him could not bloom in that cold soil. There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray, love, remember.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Dearest child, you shudder me with such dark music. Speak plain—what is it clouds your gentle mind?
Ophelia (speaking)  
There’s pansies, that’s for thoughts, and fennel and columbines, and rue for Sundays—oh, rue, for there’s bitterness enough to sour every hour. My mind is an orchard of dead petals, mother to no fruit.
Claudius (speaking)  
Ophelia, you are not yourself. Forget these flowers. Come, let us find you comfort and care.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Care? Must I be careful not to trip upon my sorrow? The violets withered when my father died—he hath committed his grave with silence. Who will listen now if I should whisper his name?  
(she sings softly)  
“And will he not come again?  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead,  
Go to thy deathbed.  
He never will come again.”
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hark, child, your sweet reason drowns in grief—what does your heart seek?
Ophelia (thinking)  
If I could pluck my heart out—just for a moment—and bury it by his side, would the ache subside? There’s an ache behind my eyes that no tears can soothe.
Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord, my lady, do you know what it is to choke on absence? I have no father and I am hollow as the bell that tolls him home.  
To Hamlet I gave my ribbon, to Polonius my prayers. Now I have only songs and the rustle of garments that are not his.  
(she twists her skirt)  
There’s a daisy for innocence lost—it withers in my palm.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Oh sweet Ophelia, let us hold you. Dry those tears and rest your weary body.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Rest? No bed is soft enough for sleep when sleep brings dreams of dirt and splinters and echoing shouts through painted walls.  
(she laughs, sharp and brittle)  
Dreams! Did they bury him upright—to better hear me weep? Or did the worms clog his ears as they do the ears of kings?
Claudius (speaking)  
Child, your words trouble the court. If there is reason left in you, tell us—what should we do?
Ophelia (thinking)  
If reason is a thread, then mine is snapped; my thoughts are beads scattered across the boards, rolling into shadows, trembling into dust.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Feed the worms, my lord—call for gravediggers! There is no music left but the keening hush of mourning.  
Sing “but tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window  
To be your Valentine.”
Gertrude (speaking)  
Hush, Ophelia, hush, you speak in riddles.
Ophelia (speaking)  
They are the only language I have left. Riddles and weeds—they grow untended, as does my heart.  
Did you hear the knock at supper-time?  
He that is mad keeps the time, and I must keep it now for two.  
Hamlet! Is he hidden in the arras, listening? My love, my ghost, my murderer. The curtains bleed with secrets.
Horatio (speaking)  
Poor lady, her mind is undone. Do you recall us, Ophelia? I am Horatio—tell me what you wish.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I wish for the river’s hush, Horatio, and the willows stooping low.  
(sings, voice trembling)  
“They bore him out of the garden,  
A handful of winter sticks—  
No blossom nor root to follow,  
Only the darkness thick.”
Ophelia (thinking)  
Songs are my skin now. If I stop singing I will vanish, fade from this cold, clean world until nothing is left but pearl tears.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister! What horror is this? Why do you grieve alone? Speak to me—what has befallen thee?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Laertes, Laertes—brother, you came too late. The bells have tolled, the chimes are set.  
Would you have a lily, or a nettle? Would you carry my sorrow in your coat pocket and let it prickle your breast?  
Go, ask father if he can speak with the dead. He is dust, bone, the whisper beneath the floor.  
I saw your letter burn.  
(she giggles, then sobs)  
All our words turn to ash in the end.
Laertes (speaking)  
Beloved Ophelia, I will avenge him, I swear! But your pain—tell me, what is it you mourn?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Your hands—your sword—avenge?  
Blood is the river and vengeance the stone.  
Sing, brother, sing with me.  
(her voice begins jagged, then grows bright)  
“For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy—  
So white and red his cheek—  
When shrouds are made from wedding sheets,  
Love circles round the bleak.”
Ophelia (thinking)  
This world is all wrong. Everything slips sidewise. I can hear father’s voice but he is not here; I run to hug him and the wall shivers with laughter.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Take her hand, Laertes. Look how she trembles. Ophelia, darling, do you know me?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Mother, mother—or are you the Queen? My mind dances between faces, one smile splitting into two shadows.  
I have made a crown of weeds, your Majesty. Take it—wear it—let the thorns speak for us all.
Gertrude (speaking)  
What means this song? What means this gift of thorns?
Ophelia (speaking)  
A crown for grief, a garland for guilt.  
If fathers die, must daughters break? Must mothers forget their names and sons become their fathers' assassins?  
There is no right anymore. There is only the river, and there is only silence.
Claudius (speaking)  
Speak, Ophelia. Do you know who is to blame?
Ophelia (thinking)  
Blame is a stone in my mouth, heavy, dragging my tongue. They all wear masks in Elsinore.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Should I point? Should I name names?  
You, my lord, wield the keys and the knives.  
There is blood on your hands, but it is paint, and the walls are running red.  
No one cares for the voice of a willow when the storm blows.
Laertes (speaking)  
Peace, Ophelia. Leave her, Majesty. Her heart is shattered.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Shatter, shatter, the glass is thin—  
If I walk to the garden, will I find him there?  
Father, can you see me now? I wear my hair loose for you, father, tangled and black with mourning.
Horatio (speaking)  
Gentle maid, is there aught I can bring? A friend, a prayer, a memory?
Ophelia (speaking)  
A memory? Is it bright? Is it soft?  
Memories drip from my fingers, cold and slimy as frogs.  
(she stares off, voice very quiet)  
The water calls, Horatio. Its arms are wide, safe and cool.  
No more dust. Only hush.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Would it be so bad to let go, to join the river's slow song? If no one understands, at least the water will keep me secret, carry my heart away gently.
Ophelia (speaking)  
No more rosemary—no more rue. I will braid my sorrow into the reeds, and when the morning comes, perhaps the birds will sing my father home.  
Farewell, all.  
(she clings to her strange bouquet, steps from the light, begins to hum again—a lullaby and a lament, winding into silence)"
"submissive, resigned",Agrees to reject Hamlet's advances and cut off contact.,"Ophelia has just been urged by her father, Polonius, to renounce Hamlet and break off all communication with him.
Ophelia (thinking)  
How heavy my heart is; to be commanded against the pull of my own affections—a cruel task, but one I cannot deny my father. The weight of filial obedience grows like stones about my neck, and yet there is no recourse but patience—resignation.
Polonius (speaking)  
Ophelia, you must hear me out, and mark me well. Young Hamlet’s vows are but instruments of his youth, sounding brass—promises as light as air. You must not trust him, nor yield your heart’s discourse to his entreaties.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Yes, my lord, I do mark your words. Each one settles upon me like dust, cold and unmoving. I obey; you are my guidance as the stars direct the tides.
Polonius (speaking)  
Such is your duty, girl. You know well enough the danger of youthful ardor running unchecked in the noble blood. It will run you to ruin and dishonor both. Assure me now: will you keep henceforth from Hamlet’s presence, nor answer letters, nor meet him in the shade where watchers cannot see?
Ophelia (speaking)  
I shall, father. My own desires I will put aside; obedience nests within me, though my feelings flutter still against its bars. I shall not answer his letters, nor seek him out, nor let the sound of his name in my chamber but as you command.
Polonius (speaking)  
You speak wisely, child. Take heart in it, though the world grows cold, there is safety in prudence. Remember, each thought you spare for him is a thread that could ensnare us all, should it catch the wrong wind.
Ophelia (thinking)  
How dreadfully well I remember—each encounter, each word he spoke. Hamlet, with eyes so deep I drowned in them unknowing, you will be a memory now, pressed between pages and never spoken aloud. This is a fate chosen for me, not by me.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister, our father speaks but truth, though it pains us to hear it. I know Hamlet has caught your fancy—yet his affections are not as free as they may seem. Princes must wed by counsel, not by wish. Protect yourself.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I thank you, dear brother, though your words strike wounds afresh. I am not blind—I see the bounds of duty drawn thick around us. I shall do as I am told, not with gladness, but with resolve, since that is all that is left me.
Laertes (speaking)  
You are brave and wise, Ophelia. I would not see you brought to sorrow through another’s inconstancy, however fair his tongue. Let us stand together, as we must.
Polonius (speaking)  
Attend now; if you should receive any message from Hamlet, any soft petition or token, bring it straight to me. Do not engage your heart in reply. Your welfare is dear to mine, and so I must seem stern.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I will, father. I give myself wholly to your care—my mind, my letters, my hopes, even my tears. If it must be this way, then let me bear it quietly, and not bring shame upon our house by any wayward act or wish.
Polonius (speaking)  
That is well. Now leave us; retire to your chamber and order your thoughts. You do your house and your father great honor.
Ophelia (thinking)  
They speak as if love were a garment to be put off at will, as if I could unwind my heart like the braid from my hair. But I am caught in their web, a motionless fly. To obey is a virtue, they say, but it is also a slow drowning. Hamlet, forgive me, wherever you are, for the walls I must raise between us.
Polonius (speaking)  
There, Laertes—you see, the girl listens, she bends as the willow does to wind. Our care must now be extra, for the Prince will not give up his pursuit so lightly.
Laertes (speaking)  
Let us trust Ophelia’s sense. She speaks with a humility I find rare. Yet, father, you must also remember she is frail, as all gentle creatures are. We must not heap too heavy a burden.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I am not made of steel, brother, but I will bear this as well as I am able. My strength lies now only in submission, that I may not displease those I love—even as I lose the love I cherished.
Polonius (speaking)  
Come, come. No more words upon it. I will trust you to keep this resolve, Ophelia.
Ophelia (thinking)  
No more words—none that I dare speak, at least. The room now feels smaller, as if my very breath is measured and observed. Every letter Hamlet sent is a secret flame I must smother in its turning. Must I tear them, or merely lock them away, unread and unanswered?
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia, if you ever grow uncertain, speak to me. Do not bear this weight alone.
Ophelia (speaking)  
You are kind, Laertes. I will keep your offer, though I think I must learn silence as my only companion, lest my tongue betray wishes that must not be voiced.
Polonius (speaking)  
To your chamber, then. And let no hour pass but in study or needlework. An idle mind is a mischief-maker; I would see you busy.
Ophelia (speaking)  
As you wish, father. All my hours shall be filled as you prescribe. There will be no corner left for fancies to take root.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I walk not of my own accord, but where I am led—as a figure in a painted scene. If my heart refuses to follow, still my body obeys. How quietly the world closes in when one’s will is not one’s own. Hamlet, you will wonder at my silence, perhaps cry out at my coldness. Believe it not my doing; let my silence say only that I am bound by threads stronger than longing.
Polonius (speaking)  
We must trust in the wisdom of our actions. Better a short pang than a lifetime’s regret.
Laertes (speaking)  
Father, is it truly necessary to cut him off so sharply? Is there no gentler path, no chance for Ophelia and Hamlet’s affection to thrive under your watch?
Polonius (speaking)  
You are young yet, Laertes, and think well of all. But royalty follows other rules, and princes love not as commoners do. This is a duty, not a cruelty.
Ophelia (speaking)  
It is hard, brother, but sometimes the harder path is the one that must be walked. I will not revolt against your guidance—I could not bear to see grief in our father’s eyes, nor disappointment shadow your face.
Laertes (speaking)  
You bear more than you should, Ophelia. Yet I trust you to walk this path with dignity.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Dignity—a word that tastes bitter in my mouth tonight. I prefer the taste of Hamlet’s laughter, the warmth of his words. Now all is memory: the brushing of hands, the secret glances. I must let them fade, must be stone, must dig my own heart from the wound and sow silence in its place.
Polonius (speaking)  
We must not dwell. Go, child. The hours grow late.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Good night to you both. I shall lock away my heart with the moon, and sleep as best I may, if sleep will come at all.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Night falls, and with it, the small freedom I possessed. Each thought of Hamlet must be banished, each longing reined tight until it withers like petals forgotten on the windowsill. They would see me pure, dutiful; I will be what they wish, though it empties me inside.  
If only he knew—if only I could say, “It is not of my will, this parting.”  
But I must bear my silence alone, and let his words, unread, linger without answer.  
Perhaps I will see him in dreams. If not, then I must dream myself colder, harder, until even my heart learns obedience."
"obedient, constrained",Is set upon Hamlet by Polonius and Claudius as a test of Hamlet's madness.,"The background: Ophelia has been approached by Hamlet in a corridor, while unobserved by all save the hidden Polonius and Claudius, who watch to determine if Hamlet's madness is love-born.
Ophelia (thinking) I am trembling. The weight of my father’s instructions is heavy upon my chest; each breath is ringed with the anxiety that I am not mistress of my own self, but the subject of a test—a snare written by hands not my own. To see Hamlet, changed so beyond the boy I loved, and not even know if these eyes of his are his own, or prisms refracting madness. Now, I must remember every word my father told me: be gentle, but clear; curious, but distant. He said, “Repel his letters, refuse his tokens”—but how shall I? My heart is divided as a stream split by a stone.
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, I pray you, how does your honour for this many a day? You seem weathered with care, pale as the margin of the moon before daybreak. Are you well?
Hamlet (speaking) Well? I, Lady, am as well as any whose blood and bone are mingled with such foul earth as Denmark. Yet all the world would ask me, “How fares Hamlet?” as if the question were the answer, and the answer lying in mud.
Ophelia (thinking) His voice is rough, like the tide against our garden wall. There is anger in his look, but more—betrayal, perhaps, or something deeper, hidden, gnawing like a worm in fruit. He does not meet my eyes. Was it me he has come for, or merely any shadow on the wall?
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, you gave me remembrances, sewn with care and your sweet words, not long past. Songs in ribbon, verses pressed by your very hand. I—I pray you, take them back; their sweetness has grown stale.
Hamlet (speaking) Ha! Are you honest, Ophelia?
Ophelia (speaking) My lord?
Hamlet (speaking) Are you honest?
Ophelia (thinking) My hands are cold. The world shrinks and all seems balanced upon this very question. What will he say if I confess my mind or conceal it? I cannot fathom his riddle.
Ophelia (speaking) My honesty would do me no harm, my lord.
Hamlet (speaking) Then, Lady, is your beauty honest too? That you can look so fair and yet wear the mask of virtue is a trick of nature, surely. For honesty would not pair so prettily with such beauteous shame.
Ophelia (speaking) My beauty, sir, is but a poor suit. I am as nature made me, and no more. If beauty and honesty do not walk hand in hand, then let me be neither.
Hamlet (speaking) You speak as one schooled to answers, neat and tidy as a catechism, but the world is not so smooth. I loved you once.
Ophelia (thinking) My heart. It stutters and aches, as if the words were swords pressed gently to my skin. Can I trust them? Or trust anything in this coil of deceit and watchfulness?
Ophelia (speaking) Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Hamlet (speaking) You should not have believed me. I have not love within me now, only bones and old sorrows roughed with dust. I loved you not.
Ophelia (speaking) I was the more deceived.
Ophelia (thinking) The words taste of iron—sharp and cold. For whose benefit does he speak so? Me, or those unseen—the shadows in the arras? Or is this madness truly his—disorder instead of artifice?
Hamlet (speaking) Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Ophelia (speaking) My lord—pray, let me return what is rightfully yours. These tokens—these letters—take them again; I would not keep them.
Hamlet (speaking) No, not I. I never gave you aught.
Ophelia (thinking) He denies the world entire; he denies the amber of his own memory and the steely ache of mine. Is he so changed—so lost he will not even claim the gifts of his own hand? Or does this serve some secret purpose, honeyed with rot?
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, you know right well you did, with words so sweet breath itself seemed less precious. But, if you forget—so must I.
Hamlet (speaking) Ha! To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, farewell.
Ophelia (speaking) O, help him, heavens! He is lost, shifting and strange as a summer river.
Hamlet (speaking) If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too.
Ophelia (thinking) He seems to see through me, or through the world—his words falling like stones from a crumbling wall. My own resolve gutters. By my father’s will I must play this role, but the lines no longer fit my mouth.
Ophelia (speaking) I shall obey, my lord. I am nothing, if not obedient.
Hamlet (speaking) God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to! I’ll have no more on’t; it hath made me mad. I say we shall have no more marriages: those that are married already—all but one—shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.
Ophelia (thinking) Obedience is a veil, and behind it my soul cowers—my breath short, my mind fluttering with questions. Polonius pressed my hand and bade me remember every word, my lady-virtue perched as fragile as glass. But Hamlet—what does he want from me? Is he angry or only lost within himself, the world all thorns and darkness?
Ophelia (speaking) Farewell, sweet lord.
Hamlet (speaking) Farewell.
(Ophelia waits, barely breathing until his steps echo away, the dust trembling beneath her. For many moments, silence. Hidden, Polonius and Claudius emerge.)
Polonius (speaking) How now, Ophelia? He has spoken hard and coldly; did you mark his wildness, Majesté? You see now—his mind is riven, obsessed, and out of joint. All comes as I forewarned.
Claudius (speaking) His words are laced with fever, but I discern in them more craft than madness. Lady, tell us: did he urge you with any sign of purpose—aught but this wildness?
Ophelia (thinking) I am still shivering; their gaze is a weight upon my soul. I have traded the storm of Hamlet for the chill of their cold eyes. Do I betray him with each recounting? Or is betrayal woven into every thread of this dark tapestry?
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, he pressed no hope, no wish. Only grief and anger, like a wound stripped bitter by salt. He bade me get to a nunnery, as if the world were poisoned for all women. He spake harshly.
Polonius (speaking) Yet see: the grief is all for you. His heart, though shattered, beats in tune to your name. I have said it—his malady springs from unrequited love.
Claudius (speaking) Or from some deeper source. There is method in this seeming frenzy. Polonius, I doubt love is all or any part. He is dangerous, lurking outside our sight. Still, Ophelia, you have served us well—your gentle hand may yet mend this troubled mind, or reveal the root.
Ophelia (thinking) Their words are daggers, though sheathed in courtesy. Have I served? Or have I only made myself once more a pawn? My heart aches; Hamlet is not as he was, and I am unheard—my own desires lost in the will of others.
Ophelia (speaking) I can but do as I am bid.
Polonius (speaking) Come, come, you are a good child. You have saved the honour of our house, and cleared the air for the King. Go now—rest. Think no more on Hamlet.
Ophelia (speaking) I shall obey, though it grieves me. Pray you, permit me. (She curtsies.)
Claudius (speaking) We shall speak again, fair Ophelia.
(Ophelia’s steps are hurried upon the stone floor, her hands pressed to her breast as if to quiet the thunder beneath.)
Ophelia (thinking) Alone, at last. The light in the corridor is thin as sorrow. I feel hollowed, spent, as if each word Hamlet gave me carved a hollow through my ribs. Yet what choice had I? To obey, as always. To serve a father, a king, a lost beloved. I am obedient—but my heart, even now, beats out its own desperate, silent song. O Hamlet, what venom is this that has swept you from yourself? Some part of you lingers in armor, haunted and wounding, and I, I am left among the ruins with my own gentle madness.
(Ophelia exits, leaving the silence disturbed only by the faint whispering draft—Polonius and Claudius remain, already plotting their next move.)"
distressed,Is treated extremely cruelly by Hamlet during their encounter while Claudius and Polonius observe.,"In the lavish yet hollow chamber, Ophelia is treated extremely cruelly by Hamlet during their encounter, all while Claudius and Polonius observe from their concealed vantage.
Ophelia (thinking)  
A trembling in my hands, as if the air itself holds knives; I am summoned to test Hamlet’s heart—this man I have so dearly loved, now so changed—I am alone before him, but watched. Words slip through my mind, each more fragile than the last. The gift my father pressed into my palm—a token to return, in pretense and in pain. I would run, but my knees are chained by duty and fear.
Hamlet (speaking)  
To be, or not to be, that is the question—whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them—Ay, there's the rub: for in that sleep of death what dreams may come—Ophelia, are you honest?
Ophelia (thinking)  
He paces like a wounded animal—so torn, so wild. Once I would have reached to still his hand, to pull the storm to calm, but now his eyes rake over me with suspicion. My heart pounds in my chest, warning of a tempest I cannot read.
Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord, I am honest—I have ever been true to you in word and thought. Why do you look on me so? What sorrow pinks your face with such sharp color?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Honest? Honest, my girl? That word weighs too heavy on your tongue. Ha! Where is your father?
Ophelia (thinking)  
His voice—laced with accusation—makes me wince as though the stones themselves have teeth. He knows. Or he suspects. Father watches, and so does the King; my tongue is not my own today.
Ophelia (speaking)  
He is at home, my lord.
Hamlet (speaking)  
At home? Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own house. Farewell.
Ophelia (speaking)  
O what offense have I, my lord, that you speak to me so? I have done nothing but loved you—if tenderness was sin, then I am damned double—but for the rest, I am innocent!
Hamlet (speaking)  
You are? God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more of it; it hath made me mad! I say, we will have no more marriages—those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go!
Ophelia (thinking)  
His words fall upon me like stones in a rising tide, each more suffocating than the last. To a nunnery? Is this renunciation or a curse? The faces behind the tapestry prick my back with invisible daggers—my father, the King. I am a stage, a proof, a mirror shattered at his feet.
Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord—do you not know me? You dart from harshness to riddles. Your eyes won’t rest upon mine. If I have wronged you, let me kneel and beg forgiveness, for I would rather spend my life in penance than bear your scorn. Your love was once my world!
Hamlet (speaking)  
Love? Ha! You should not have believed me. For virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Were the stones beneath my shoes molten it would sting less than this: denial, cold and resolute. He spits my heart upon the floor, uncaring in his madness or feigned madness. Every word from his lips peels another layer of belief from my soul.
Ophelia (speaking)  
You did love me—once. Your breath bore heat enough to light my winter, your words made poems blossom in my blood. Why do you seek to unmake all we have shared? If this is madness, let me weep with you. If it is anger, let me assuage it. Speak to me not as a stranger, not as your foe, but as the Ophelia you once held.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Get thee to a nunnery, go! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in. Go thy ways to a nunnery!
Ophelia (thinking)  
My hands shake, and I clutch the tokens he once gave—letters, words of hope, now ash in the mouth. He accuses me, but of what sin? My body stings from shame that is not mine. I would run—but where, Ophelia, where? In this court, nothing belongs to me—not even my pain.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Take back what you gave me—these tokens, your letters, all cherished so dearly. They burn my palm, torn from meaning by your words. If your love was false, let these be buried with it.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Ha—are you honest? Are you fair? You deal in falsehood. The world is rotten. I once gave you love, but love is maggot-ridden. Take your tokens—they are nothing now. Get thee to a nunnery—would thou be innocent, keep far from men like me.
Polonius (speaking)  
(whispering from behind the arras)  
Such words! He raves in cruelty. Yet see, her heart may falter—her duty bends her, but her soul will shatter.
Claudius (speaking)  
(whispering)  
He is wrought beyond measure. See how she trembles—the girl will break. This madness must be cured or caged.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Even as I stand, their whispers crawl across my skin. My humiliation is their entertainment. My grief, my confusion—public, dissected, twisted. Is there no corner of this heart unlit by their gaze? Am I loved by none—abandoned by Hamlet, used by father, watched by the King?
Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord, your words are daggers, and yet they cut me less than your eyes. If you cannot love me, let me retreat. Let me gather what tattered dignity I retain and hide it where no one can gaze. Please—do not force me to stand here, unraveling, in the gaze of all.
Hamlet (speaking)  
You have made me what I am—a man bereft of trust, harrowed with suspicion. Go! Go, and remember: the world will break you, will mar your beauty and devour your hopes. Trust no man—and least of all, trust Hamlet.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Heat rises in my cheeks—mortification and longing in equal measure. I turn the ring over in my palm, a relic of an innocence already lost. My mouth is dry. I wish to scream, to weep, to entreat someone for mercy, but the silence lengthens, a chasm none can cross.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Then farewell, sweet prince—once sweet, now thorn and venom. I pray you find the peace you so scorn. If curses could heal, yours would cure the world. I will do as you bid, for I am no more than dust at your feet.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Go, and do not return. There is nothing in Denmark for you now.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Everything shakes—my legs, my throat, the lattice of my thoughts. His cruelty splinters me but I hold the pieces close, as if they are all I am. Is this what love becomes? A theater for men’s grief and suspicion? Claudius and my father will rush to me, perhaps with pity. I wish I could vanish, let the earth crack wide and devour me whole.
Claudius (speaking)  
(stepping forward now, voice tight)  
Gentle Ophelia, come away. This trial has stripped you raw. We have seen enough.
Polonius (speaking)  
Daughter, you must not flutter so—come, compose yourself. You have served your purpose.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I am composed, Father—as composed as glass after a stone’s kiss. If I have served, let me now rest. I have no more words.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I let them lead me away, numbness settling behind my eyes. I am emptied, as if Hamlet’s cruelty carved me hollow for all to see. In the shadows of this palace, nothing of me remains except echo and ache. Let me dissolve—silent, unseen.
Polonius (speaking)  
Brave girl. The court demands fortitude. You shall not be forgotten.
Claudius (speaking)  
We must tend to her; madness begets madness.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Let them speak of madness—the madness of men, the madness their schemes breed. I have been made a vessel for their fears, my suffering proof of another’s crime. All I want now is the oblivion of water, the hush that follows when cruelty finally exhausts itself.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I thank you, my lords.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I feel every gaze upon me as a brand—marking, not warming. I long for the willow and the river, for any gentle place this world cannot find me. Dear God, grant me the peace not of men, but of stones and stars, unfeeling and unbroken.
Hamlet (speaking)  
(voice echoing as she recedes)  
Remember well, Ophelia—remember what men are made of.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I will remember. I will remember until remembering is no longer possible and even my dreams release me from it—for the world, and Hamlet, have taught me well."
"madness, grief",Loses her wits and behaves erratically following her father's death.,"Background: She loses her wits and behaves erratically following her father's death.
Ophelia (thinking) The walls are closing in. It is cold—colder than the earth my father now sleeps beneath. My tongue tastes salt but it is not from the sea. And they stare at me, they all stare, and they do not see—oh, never see—the shape the world has become. I am unstitched.
Ophelia (speaking) They told me to wear black, did they not? As if cloth could be penance for the shovel’s bite—oh, Mother, do you see the stain? My hands, they will not wash clean. The garden creeps through my nails. There is mud behind my eyes.
Gertrude (speaking) My sweet Ophelia, the air is heavy with your sorrow. Please, daughter, rest. The hour is late and you have not eaten since the sun deserted us.
Ophelia (speaking) Rest? Mother, what is rest? A bed, a shroud—a cradle for the hollow bones of birds. The reeds sing to me when I sleep. They call his name in greenish tongues. Do you not hear them whisper—whisper how he fell?
Claudius (speaking) She’s undone. Can none soothe her? The girl needs solace, not more turmoil—the castle cranes its neck because of her weeping.
Ophelia (thinking) My teeth chatter and the world is split wide, like a fish on a bank—gaping, still, but breathless. They circle me, voices droning like flies on a wound. Is this madness, to see them all as shadows? Father, is that you in the corner, smiling?
Ophelia (speaking) Solace! A word for the soft-makers, those who powder pain with painted hands. I do not want your comfort, uncle—no, king—no, snake-oil seller. Father spoke through the floorboards last night; his voice rang wood-clotted through my breast. “Do not believe them,” he said. “They drink foul water in golden cups.”
Gertrude (speaking) Oh, Ophelia, please—these babblings wound me. Let your mother kiss your tears, my darling girl.
Ophelia (speaking) My tears are black pearls, pressed into riverbed silt. If I let you touch them, Mother, you will drown, like poor drowned puppies tied in a sack.
Horatio (speaking) Lady, perhaps a walk in the fresh air—some gentle company—could ease your fever. The night smells of honeysuckle, and the stars still burn.
Ophelia (speaking) The stars are graves, Horatio. Each one burns for the fathers who rot below. I pluck my gown and find petals and worms—pretty trade, yes? I’ll wear them for a crown. I would be queen of worms. Would they bow, do you think, Uncle?
Claudius (speaking) This is folly, childish nonsense. We cannot permit—
Ophelia (speaking) Permit! Permit! You have papers for everything: for wars, and funerals, and treason, and yes, for daughters gone to night. Shall I sign your parchment with a kiss, or with the blood beneath my nails? My head is full of buzzing. There are bees behind my eyes. They make honey of my sorrow.
Gertrude (speaking) Let her be, Claudius. Let her grieve as she must. 
Ophelia (thinking) They smooth my hair but do not see that it is matted with loss. My tongue trips on weeds. I remember being a child, pressing my ear to Father’s chest and hearing the world made safe.
Ophelia (speaking) Mother, do you remember when we would string daisies for a chain? Daisies for innocence, and rue for regret. I gather them still, in my mind, but now the blossoms bite. Do you think the river will forgive me, if I walk too close? Would it hush me, as you once did?
Gertrude (speaking) Hush now, my dearing, hush. I will not let the river have you.
Ophelia (speaking) Rivers want what is lost. They are made for swallowing. The reeds are mourning bands and willow tears. I watch them bow for every little death.
Horatio (speaking) Shall I fetch Laertes, Ophelia? Your brother asks for you. Perhaps his voice could—
Ophelia (speaking) Laertes—he weeps a hero’s tears. They glitter like silver instruments. Brother, come. Come see what is left of your sister: a locket of hair, a sigh, a hollow rib. Father took the rest—down, down, clutching clods and cursing men.
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia! Sister! By all saints, what’s become of you? You were laughter and light. Now you drift like a ghost no prayers can bind.
Ophelia (speaking) The saints have gone to war, Laertes, and left me their broken wings. Shall I fly, brother? Shall I mount the parapet and launch myself into sorrow’s arms? Would you catch me, or let the wind have her say?
Laertes (speaking) Stay, sweet. No precipice, no river, no darkened room. Stay.
Ophelia (thinking) His hand is warm. Briefly—so briefly—I remember sunlight. And then the storm returns: colors too bright, voices a shriek. I grasp for Father’s shadow but find only dust.
Ophelia (speaking) I have a song for you all—a wedding song, though the bride is dead. “He is dead and gone, lady / He is dead and gone; / At his head a grass-green turf, / At his heels a stone.” Do you hear it? The blackbirds are my chorus.
Gertrude (speaking) Enough, Ophelia! You torment yourself—these songs are nightmares. Come, let us sit by the fire.
Ophelia (speaking) The fire! Shall I consign my memories to flame? Shall I knot my hair in burning embers and see what sparks fly? The world is burning, mother, under our feet—do you not smell the smoke? Perhaps it is his shroud twisting in the wind.
Claudius (speaking) This cannot continue. Bring the physician—she needs strong draughts, binding herbs.
Ophelia (speaking) The physician! He will bleed me with leeches, and maybe, with luck, drain the ache. But the pain refills itself, a bottomless cup. I have drunk to dregs and am still not satisfied. Father, father—why did you not keep your promise? Weren’t you to come back for me, with the sunrise in your pocket?
Horatio (speaking) Ophelia, let us pray together. If words can heal, let us seek their grace.
Ophelia (speaking) I pray to splintered wood and worm-filled earth. My prayers are bats, wheeling and blind. They shriek in the rafters—do you not hear them, Horatio?
Laertes (speaking) Sister—look at me. There is still love. The dead cannot un-love us.
Ophelia (speaking) Love is a cracked mirror—I peer, but my face is split into crosswise lines. If you loved Father, why did you go away? When you left, the house grew smaller. Now there is no house, only corners filled with smoke.
Gertrude (speaking) We all loved him, Ophelia. You are not alone.
Ophelia (speaking) Aloneness is a pit with no bottom. I call and no one answers. The birds do not build their nests in me—they only pluck, pluck, pluck my hair for lining. Do you want a garland, Mother? Here—twisting nettles and sorrow’s stems.
Claudius (speaking) Enough! Will no one quiet her? She is turning the court to an asylum.
Horatio (speaking) Peace, my lord. Her spirit is wounded, not wicked. Such pain will pass—given time.
Ophelia (thinking) Time—it is a slow poison. I taste metal in my mouth. Did Father taste time as he died? Did it clot his veins? There is a clock in my chest and the hands are spinning, wild and wrong.
Ophelia (speaking) You want me to heal, but you hand me salt and knives. I would give you violets, but they withered all when my father died. He would not let me weep alone—though now, alone is all there is.
Laertes (speaking) I am here, Ophelia. I will not leave you again. Take my hand.
Ophelia (speaking) Your hand is a tether—I am a kite, brother. The string is frayed. The sky wants me, and Father calls from below: “Remember me, remember…” But memory is a dagger, dancing behind my ribs.
Gertrude (speaking) Lie down, child. Dream only of dawns.
Ophelia (speaking) Dawn is only dusk with a painted mask. I am not fooled. When the sun rises, his grave is still cold. When the sun rises, I am still empty.
Claudius (speaking) If she cannot be soothed, she must be contained. Before she brings the whole house into mourning.
Ophelia (thinking) Contain me? Bottle a storm, bury a river—impossible tasks for trembling men. I am the shriek in the eaves, the shadow at the stair. I will not be locked away. I have lost my wits, but gained strange new eyes. Maybe the mad see true.
Ophelia (speaking) Lock your doors, bar your windows, wash your hands with vinegar—nothing keeps out sorrow. Grief is a worm; it finds its way inside, quiet, patient, hungry. Father, are you listening? When you left, you took all the light. Now I am the dark. Now I am the pit. Now I am your shroud, walking, singing, untethered, undone.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, don’t—please, I am lost without you. 
Ophelia (speaking) We are all lost, Laertes. Only the water knows the way home.
Ophelia (thinking) And the river is calling. The stones are soft beneath my feet. The night air is thick, the moon is cracked, and I am drifting, drifting—his voice a thread, winding endlessly through reeds and wailing beds and the broken chamber of my heart."
"distraught, grief-stricken","Ophelia, devastated by her father's death and Hamlet's actions, drowns while singing sad love songs.","In a lonely glade sloping to a streaming brook, Ophelia, devastated by her father's death and Hamlet's actions, drowns while singing sad love songs.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The willows stoop to drink the water; they bend as if to comfort me, and yet, like all the world, they cannot reach far enough. I wish it had rained today—then at least the clouds could have wept with me. Everything is too bright. My father: gone, called to dust and darkness by means too cruel for gentle speech. And Hamlet…the prince, whose words made my heart a garden, sharp with pain. The air is too thin. I must sing; there is nothing left but singing.
Ophelia (speaking)  
They bore him bare-faced on the bier,  
Hey non, nonny, nonny, hey nonny;  
And in his grave rained many a tear—  
Fare you well, my dove.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia! My poor, broken Ophelia—what brings you in such disarray? You look pale as death, your hands full of weeds, your gown wandering in tatters. Return, child, from the brook’s edge. Let it not call you.
Ophelia (thinking)  
She sounds distant, as though through glass. I cannot listen to her now; it’s all echoes, all shadows. Father, I see your face in the rippling, and your eyes ask questions I cannot answer. The water is more honest than the world: it cares nothing for titles or bargains or whispered lies.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Pray you, mark.  
White his shroud as the mountain snow—  
Larded with sweet flowers,  
That bewept to the grave did go  
With true-love showers.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Sweet child, your mind’s adrift as reeds upon the water. Come back to the bank. Let me warm you. Words are dangerous things when sorrow seeds them so.
Ophelia (speaking)  
They say the owl was a baker’s daughter…Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.  
There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me: we may call it herb-grace o’ Sundays. Oh! you must wear your rue with a difference.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister! What vision is this? Why stand you so near the stream, head crowned with nettles and daisies? Come, Ophelia, this is not a fit place for your grief.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Laertes—his voice shakes, like a ship’s sail whipping in a storm. He is the last branch left to me from the family tree, but I cannot reach him. What is there to say to my brother, who dreams of vengeance, who cannot see the weight pressing upon my chest and filling my mouth with stony silence?
Ophelia (speaking)  
There’s a daisy—I would give you violet, but they withered all when my father died.  
They say he made a good end…For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
Laertes (speaking)  
O heavens! She is not herself. Her words loop and twist like the stream. Gertrude, help me draw her away!
Ophelia (thinking)  
Their voices weigh me down, drag me back to dry sorrow; but the water inches closer, cool arms opening, whispering in currents. The songs know my secrets. Songs do not judge, do not betray.
Ophelia (speaking)  
And will he not come again?  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead:  
Go to thy death-bed,  
He never will come again.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, think of your father as at rest, safe from court conspiracies and clashing swords. The world still needs you. Hamlet needs you.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Needs me? He dashed my heart—first sweet, then cruel. He took from me the future I spun from dreams and left me threadbare with grief. My hands remember his touch, but it’s cold now, a memory of warmth. The wind tastes of flowers left upon the grave.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Tomorrow is St. Valentine’s day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window,  
To be your Valentine.  
Then up he rose and donned his clothes,  
And dupp’d the chamber door;  
Let in the maid, that out a maid  
Never departed more.
Laertes (speaking)  
Do not sing so, Ophelia! All the birds hush; the world itself listens in sorrow. Come, let me guide you from the stream, let me shelter you as our father once did.
Ophelia (thinking)  
He does not understand. The stream is the only place unspoiled by men’s ambitions and lies. It asks for no answers. There is forgiveness in the cold, in the wet grass. There is peace at the bottom.
Ophelia (speaking)  
By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
Alack, and fie for shame!  
Young men will do’t, if they come to’t—  
By Cock, they are to blame.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
There’s madness in your melody, my poor girl. No spring nor summer will replace your solace if you yield to the water’s call.
Ophelia (thinking)  
They do not see how the world has grown hollow, echoing. My feet are heavy with stones that have no name. Each song loosens my hold on this life.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I would give you violets, but they all withered when my father died.  
They say he made a good end—  
His shroud covered in flowers, white as snow.
Laertes (speaking)  
Stay! For the love you bore our father, tarry, Ophelia—let my arms be your haven.
Ophelia (thinking)  
If arms could heal, I would not weep. If love could restore, I would not sing. My father’s voice is everywhere and nowhere. Hamlet’s words left me adrift, longing for an anchor.
Ophelia (speaking)  
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance—pray you, love, remember.  
And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
She gives away flowers as though they were words, but none of us knows what her heart is giving away.
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia, the water is swelling! Come back—please, come back.
Ophelia (thinking)  
My feet are wet. Water comes up through my slippers, seeping through silk, cold and gentle. It does not question, only welcomes. The pain hushes, secrets streaming away. I cannot bear the weight of this life—let it soften, let it dissolve.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Drown me not with weeping,  
For I go where sorrow cannot find me,  
Longing for soft forgetting—  
The stream shall be my lullaby.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not—Ophelia, child, I beg you, turn back! You are pale as the flowers you scatter. Do not let sorrow swallow you whole.
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia! Sister! If you loved me—if you loved our father—do not step further; take my hand—I am your brother. Hear me!
Ophelia (thinking)  
Love is a weight, a chain about the heart. I carry too much. Even brotherly arms cannot pull me back; the stream’s cold comfort lulls my senses. Father, I come. Hamlet, I forgive you, though you broke me.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;  
Good night, good night.
Laertes (speaking)  
No!—Ophelia! She sinks! Her gown, heavy with water—her lips pale—oh, gods, help her! She disappears—Ophelia!
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Let the world bear witness: grief has claimed her, and the current carries away what stone and steel could not destroy—innocence.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Cold surrounds me—silk billows and blooms around my limbs. Sounds dim, then dimmer. Strange—there is quiet, at last, and flowers drift above. My lungs ache for breath, but the ache is soft, far away. Faces—Laertes, motherly queen—blur at the surface, unreachable. Light above, darkness below. I sink, I float.  
Father, I am coming.
Ophelia (speaking)  
And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead:  
Go to thy death-bed,  
He never will come again.
Laertes (speaking)  
She is gone. Torn by sorrow, drowned by anguish and by love unreturned. Cursed be the makers of tragedy—cursed those who wove her sorrow!
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Let flowers be strewn on the water; let her be mourned, and let the quiet witness of the stream become her shroud.
Ophelia (thinking)  
If there is warmth, it is in the memory of hands I loved, of songs I sang. All the hurt blurs as the water holds me.  
May I be forgiven. May there be peace.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Sweet rosemary, for remembrance,  
And rue to soften pain—  
Farewell, love, and all the world’s sorrow,  
I sleep beneath the rain.
Laertes (speaking)  
The world shall rue this loss;  
The water keeps her secrets, but my heart will not be silent!  
Rest you well, Ophelia.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Rest you well, gentle maid.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Rest. Once, I prayed for the world to grow quieter. The stream grants what life could not. It sings me to sleep.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Good night."
"distraught, hopeless","Ophelia drowns, singing sad songs, overcome by grief for her father and Hamlet's actions.","Amid a tangle of willows overhanging the shimmering brook, Ophelia wanders, her gown trailing in the water, singing sad, mournful songs as the weight of her father’s death and Hamlet’s betrayal bear heavy upon her spirit.
Ophelia (thinking)  
How strange the world is, how suddenly it bends and breaks. What once sparkled with promise now drowns in shadow—my father gone, my heart shattered by Hamlet’s cruel hands. The water glistens, brighter than any hope left in me. I remember his arms, his face twisted in sorrow and then in accusation. For whom do I live, now that love and kin are ghosts?
Ophelia (speaking)  
They bore him barefaced on the bier,  
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny,  
And in his grave rained many a tear.  
Ah me! Mother, where is your comfort? The lilies wag their heads, but none are laurels for my brow. Father, shall I meet thee in the chill mud below? The sun lies low—my sky bleeds its gold for me this day.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sweet sister, why do you wander thus, singing sorrow into the morning? Your feet are wet, your gown heavy. Ophelia, return with me! Let us bind your wounds in the warmth of home.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Home. The word curdles on my tongue. There is no warmth for me, not with Polonius stung by death, not with Hamlet’s love turned venom. I am bodiless, drifting. Should I answer him, or let myself dissolve and float as memories do?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Laertes, my brother! The river sings to me—hear it, so sweet, so low! You see but the mortals in me, weighed by sorrow. I speak with the water now, and the willow. The sedges whisper Father’s name, and Lady Death beckons with white fingers. Our home is no longer mine; I belong to the deep reeds, to the songs only madness hears.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, what have they done to you? Child, grief’s poison seeps too far. Come, I shall guide you back to gentle land. Let go the shadows—let me keep you here, above the flood, beside the fire.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The Queen—her voice once kindness, now sorrow—she pities me. But how can pity knit these sundered seams? Her words can’t dry the rippled glass beneath me, nor unspill my father’s blood. Oh, Hamlet! Your vows were sharp as knives—your embrace, a noose about my soul.
Ophelia (speaking)  
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance. Pray, love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts. I have violets here, but they all withered when my father died. They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Alas! Poor soul, she never sang as I do. Mother Queen, your arms cannot hold me, not now; the water is soft, gentle as his lies.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Ophelia! Do not yield to the chill that seeps from these lonely waters. Look into my eyes—find there the truth I could not utter; sorrow has blackened my mind, not love. The world’s deception swallowed me. Forgive me, sweet maid, if ever sweet I called you.
Ophelia (thinking)  
His face, pale and frantic—the boy who pressed a posy to my lips by the sundial. Is this a dream? Or did all truth flee from Hamlet’s words? My eyes sting, the willow’s leaves bend to meet me, their tears for my father or for me? Should I believe him once more, or let this river take every word?
Ophelia (speaking)  
My Lord, my love, how sharp your absence cuts! You put to death the song that danced on my lips, left me dust and silence. Your love clothed itself in riddles, trailing daggers behind words. I am frightened of the world you made for me, Hamlet—one where fathers bleed and lovers wound. Will the river cradle me better than you did?
Hamlet (speaking)  
Would I were not the monster you now behold, Ophelia. My hand shook when I pressed that blade; my heart broke when you turned away. There is madness in Denmark, and more in me, but never once did I stop loving you—though all signs contrived to drag me from your side. I beg you: step from the water. Let my remorse be the weight; let not your life be the price.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Remorse—so frail a bridge above this tide. His words flow to me, gentle, earnest—yet every syllable drags a memory sharp as ice. I see Father’s mouth, agape in a final question; hear the riddle Hamlet posed and the laughter that cracked my resolve. Is there anything left to save? The current tugs my ankles, cold and inviting.
Ophelia (speaking)  
We know what we are, but know not what we may be. I sought to be your joy, Hamlet, but became but an echo—hollow, reverberating in this haunted place. My feet are rooted in silt, my hands in song and sorrow. If I walk away, who will sing for the dead? Who will gather thyme and rue? My purpose is undone; let me sleep, where the river covers all shame, all memory.
Laertes (speaking)  
Do not give yourself to the water, Ophelia! The world has wounds, yes, but your voice is balm to them still. Return, and let me fight for you—let me strike the villains and right all wrongs. Your spirit is not spent; you are not alone.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Alone, though voices call. They are distant, as if filtered through a wall of glass. Only the river is near, and its embrace promises forgetfulness—sweet oblivion. To return to grief is to return to the hollow ache of absence. The world is jagged, broken; in the water, I am whole—a ripple, a melody unmoored.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Sister’s rose, brother’s thorn! I would return, if returning meant peace—but the world is all storm and no safe port. Father’s voice curdles in my mind, heavy as stones in my pockets. Let the world rage on; I seek hush. Let me be a garland for the eddy, a song for the silt.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Stay, dear heart. Let not your sorrow draw you beneath. We all have grieved—and yet we breathe on. Let your voice entwine with mine, and we shall mourn together, not in silence, not alone.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Her eyes glisten with unshed tears—perhaps once she knew loss as I do. Yet my grief gnaws at the inside—a silent beast with teeth of glass. I have no words left, only fragments of rhyme, spatters of memory. The water is above my knees now, the dress so heavy, limbs waning. Is this surrender, or flight?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Listen:  
How should I your true love know  
From another one?  
By his cockle hat and staff,  
And his sandal shoon.  
He is dead and gone, lady,  
He is dead and gone;  
At his head a grass-green turf,  
At his heels a stone.  
My heart—oh, my heart—aches for the turning. Will you remember me, as willow remembers rain? Will the water carry me to my father’s arms, or to a silence I cannot yet imagine? If there is soul beyond grief, let it find me in the deep.
Hamlet (speaking)  
God’s wounds, Ophelia, do not yield! There is still light. If you go, my world is forfeit—yours is the last and brightest star. Let us mend together, if ever mending there could be. Reach for me, for this trembling hand aches to save what I have destroyed.
Ophelia (thinking)  
His hand—trembling, hesitant, the same that cut so deep. There is longing there, a plea that drags at my convictions, yet my bones ache with tiredness. The water is sweet, cool. My lungs burn for peace. Yet, perhaps, for him, for my mother, my brother, a word more.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I have but a moment’s grace left. Between the sky and the drowning green, I hold wandering thoughts: Hamlet, Laertes, Mother Queen—do not curse my fading. Forgive what was broken by men’s ambitions. Remember the laughter under apricot trees, the songs at dusk. Walk softly where the waters meet the stone, for I shall linger as a whisper—as a hymn; sorrow passing through your hands like silt.
Laertes (speaking)  
I will remember, Ophelia. Though grief tears my heart, I will not let your song die unsung. My memory will cradle you, my vengeance protect you, my love surround you, even as you slip below.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The waters take me; the song ebbs from my lips. Peace, thin and tentative, steals through my limbs. Shall I dream? Shall I see Father once more? My mouth fills with river, and my burdens, at last, dissolve.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Goodnight, sweet ladies. Goodnight, sweet ladies. Goodnight, goodnight.

The current stirs, carrying the last breath of her melody upstream. The boughs weep in quiet witness as her garlanded figure slips beneath the water, sorrow and song blending into silence."
distraught,"Ophelia, overwhelmed by her father's death and Hamlet's madness, drowns herself.","The world twists and buckles around Ophelia, who stands at the edge of a churning brook, her mind shattered by the relentless grief of her father’s death and the wild betrayal she has suffered from Hamlet.
Ophelia (thinking) My feet are slick upon the moss, the stones loose and cruel beneath the water’s hush. Father, are you below the earth or do you drift with every ripple? I see your face in every droplet, blurred and beckoning. What is a daughter when her tether is cut, when she is loosed and left to the whim of madness or men?
Ophelia (speaking) They told me once the river washed the sins away. Did you know that, father? Is there a lullaby for the lost, for those who wander into the cold because their hearts have been severed?
Gertrude (speaking) Sweet Ophelia, do not linger so near the current. Come, child, you are pale. There is comfort to be found and I will gather it for you, as a mother should. Tell me your sorrow so I may shoulder it, at least for this hour.
Ophelia (thinking) The Queen’s voice floats, soft as the wind stirring lilies, but I am untethered; each syllable slips by like petals torn in a storm. Her hands reach but cannot find me. Motherless, fatherless, I wade deeper into silence.
Ophelia (speaking) Comfort, madam? I have given comfort—buried in my father’s shroud. I have worn comfort, when Hamlet’s eyes pressed hope into my soul. But now there is only this—cold, and the memory of a song.
Gertrude (speaking) Your father was noble, and his death wounds us all. But you must not surrender to despair, Ophelia. The days will come gentle again, I promise you. You are too precious to lose.
Ophelia (speaking) Precious? The pluckèd rose is precious only for a breath, then it withers. Would you have me wither, too? Each day comes like a blow, soft or sharp—I cannot tell.
Hamlet (speaking) Ophelia…Ophelia, do not turn from me. I know I have been harsh, but I am hunted by ghosts and doubts. I loved you once. I did. I love you in strange and bitter measure still.
Ophelia (thinking) His words scrape as the stones at the water’s edge—truth, then lie, then nothing. My heart is a hollow shell, scoured clean by tides of hope and terror.
Ophelia (speaking) You changed, Hamlet. The stars you mapped in my eyes have vanished. You are a prince, crowned with curses. My love is a garment torn at the seams by your hands.
Hamlet (speaking) The world is rotten, Ophelia. Would you have me smile and feign delight when daggers twist behind every curtain? There is no place for softness in Elsinore.
Ophelia (speaking) Then what for me? My softness, my silken words—do I stifled them and wear iron? Or do I drift, as your mother drifts, as your father lies in sleep unending?
Gertrude (speaking) Come away from the water, Ophelia. Let me cradle you, as I never cradled my own sorrows. Look how the day bends low, weeping in sympathy for your pain.
Ophelia (thinking) Sorrows gather like reeds. To be comforted is to be bound anew—fragile knots that will only break again. No mother’s arms can hold the bones of a heart that has shattered.
Ophelia (speaking) There are violets, for faithfulness—withered, as all faith withers. And rosemary, that’s for remembrance. Will you remember me, Hamlet, when the garden grows quiet?
Hamlet (speaking) Do not speak of gardens or graves! I cannot bear to see you wither, Ophelia. Stay! Forgive me. Let us find some patch of sunlight and lay these ghosts to rest.
Ophelia (speaking) Sunlight cannot reach the roots of what has gone rotten. Something in me is broken, Hamlet. I dreamed of crowns of spring, and now the earth is frozen.
Gertrude (speaking) Listen to me, gentle girl. You are not alone. There are those who love you, those who mourn your sorrow too. Come home with me.
Ophelia (thinking) Home is a door closed forever. My father is earth. My Hamlet is madness. The world is a chamber filled with water, rising. I cannot breathe in this house, this skin, these days.
Ophelia (speaking) I do not know the way home. The path is lost, overgrown. I will garland myself with weeds and slip beneath the rippling sky—the water knows my grief. The water can hold what I have lost.
Hamlet (speaking) Ophelia, leave the brook. Let me walk with you, just one more turn of the garden. Cast away these herbs—let me gather you instead.
Ophelia (thinking) My feet are numb. The current tugs; it is gentler than your hands, Hamlet. Was it love or was it madness? Was it ever real, or only a dream spun from the fever of your revenge?
Ophelia (speaking) I have sung all my songs. I have wept at every stone. Now the river calls in lullabies, in the pulse of water round my ankles. Father, are you there? Hamlet, will you remember me?
Gertrude (speaking) You will break us with your sorrow, child. Put down the flowers. Return to light.
Ophelia (speaking) I am broken already, madam. What is left cannot bear the brightness above—only the hush below.
Hamlet (speaking) If you love me, Ophelia, stay. If you love me, fight.
Ophelia (thinking) To fight is to twist in agony, to beg for what cannot return—a father’s hand, a future with Hamlet, the laughter of childhood summers. There is peace in letting go. There is only water.
Ophelia (speaking) My love was gentle, and it died. My hope was delicate, and it broke. Make of my memory a garland and cast it upon the stream—let the water bear it to the sea.
Gertrude (speaking) Ophelia, no! Look to me, look to the shore. There is time. There is still time.
Ophelia (speaking) Time is a current sweeping all away. I release the violets for faithlessness, the rosemary for remembrance, the pansies for thoughts. Let the river take them all. Let the cold cradle what the world will not.
Hamlet (speaking) I have been cruel where I meant to be kind. Forgive me, Ophelia. Do not vanish into shadow.
Ophelia (thinking) Forgiveness is a thread unwinding, a shroud in which I wrap myself. The water swells to greet me. It murmurs secrets even you cannot betray, Hamlet.
Ophelia (speaking) There is a willow grows aslant a brook, and beneath it I shall lie. My arms a garland, my breath a sigh. Remember me not as I am, but as I once was—whole, trusting, pure.
Gertrude (speaking) I would give you wings to flee this sorrow, Ophelia. Do not surrender. I beg you.
Ophelia (thinking) I am a feather caught upon the flood, an echo fading behind every stone. No wings remain to me—the sky is too wide, the world too cold.
Ophelia (speaking) Hark, the brook is singing. I go to join its song. Father, Hamlet, Queen—I loved you all. None knew how much.
Hamlet (speaking) No, Ophelia. Not like this. Stay. Speak. Let me save you—let me try.
Ophelia (speaking) Some hearts are beyond saving, sweet prince. I leave you with my ghost, my garland, my silence.
Ophelia (thinking) The bank falls away, water climbs my skin—cold, soft, relentless. I am lighter than sorrow, lighter than breath. I am nothing, and in being nothing, perhaps—at last—I am free.
Ophelia (speaking) Good night, sweet world. Good night, my heart’s ruin. Good night.
Gertrude (speaking) She slips beneath the water—Oh, poor Ophelia! Gone, like morning dew vanished in the heat of grief.
Hamlet (speaking) I am undone.
Ophelia (thinking) My hair floats behind me, a wedding veil unclaimed. My fingers drift, loose as promises. The brook closes above, cool and endless. I do not fear. I do not dream. The silence is a balm, and now—at last—all pain is washed away."
distressed,"Ophelia attempts to return Hamlet's gifts and letters, indicating a troubled romantic history.","The room is heavy with silence as Ophelia attempts to return Hamlet's gifts and letters, indicating a troubled romantic history.
Ophelia (thinking) The parchment trembles in my hand, its edges crumpled by nights pressed to my heart—what words, now empty, cling to the fibers? These tokens are heavy, heavier than my hope. I must see him, I must give these back, lest I drown in memory.
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, these remembrances—they are no longer mine to keep. I have collected what once was gentle and full of promise, but now they wound me with the very hand that bestowed them. I beg you, accept them again.
Hamlet (speaking) Ophelia, are you so cruel as to return the pieces of yourself you gave so freely? Have you not cherished them as I cherished your words? What madness has chilled your heart to thus unbind yourself from me?
Ophelia (thinking) His eyes—searching, resentful—plead for an answer I dare not name. I want to cling, yet every word I speak must be a blade.
Ophelia (speaking) There is no art in holding onto what causes pain. These letters lie here, yes, but they burn with memories of laughter gone sour. I did love you once—be certain of that. But now all is fear and doubt.
Hamlet (speaking) Fear and doubt—have I become so monstrous to you? Have I given offense so grave that love cannot remember itself? Did I not swear to guard your heart? What poison has been poured into your ear, Ophelia?
Ophelia (thinking) How to answer him? How to tell him that his madness, the darkness that gathers in him, unravels all we wove together? My father—my brother—warned me, yet my soul cannot betray what I once felt.
Ophelia (speaking) It is not poison, Hamlet, but sorrow. Your words lately are wild. You turn from me, you jeer, you scorn my gentleness. I cannot join you in your torment.
Hamlet (speaking) Must I wear the mask of madness forever, if only to see whether you truly loved me? If you measure my worth by the color of my mind today, are you not fickle too?
Ophelia (thinking) He twists every tenderness back upon me. Still, I must not waver. I must be steel—just this once.
Ophelia (speaking) Take your tokens. They are thorns now, not blossoms. Whether you are mad or wise, I cannot—I dare not—follow you further down that road.
Hamlet (speaking) Then what is left between us? Shall the air where we dwelled together lie empty forever? Will you abandon me when every hand is turned against me?
Ophelia (thinking) His pain tugs at me. I want nothing more than to comfort him, to cradle his head and say all will be well. But I know it must not be.
Ophelia (speaking) I would not forsake you, Hamlet, if there were hope within your gaze. But I am frightened, and you are not the man I once knew. Whatever love was here has lost its shelter.
Hamlet (speaking) So you believe the tales, Ophelia. You see in me a beast. You, who swore to trust my soul, now bring counsel and rumor instead of faith. Did I not confide to you my deepest griefs?
Ophelia (thinking) He tests the boundaries of my resolve, probes every weakness. I wish for ease—I wish for escape. But escape is not for me.
Ophelia (speaking) The world presses on us, Hamlet. My father watches me as though I am but a dove for trade. You rail in the halls like a storm unchained. I am ground between fear for you and duty to my family. Can you not see my torment?
Hamlet (speaking) Torment, yes. I see it—and I suffer by it tenfold. But your love falters at the first touch of hardship. Is that love, Ophelia? When I am surrounded by enemies, will you too turn away?
Ophelia (thinking) Is my love so frail? Or is it that his agony eclipses all, even what we could have shared? My heart aches with the truth I must speak.
Ophelia (speaking) I am not strong enough to bear your anger or your grief. Even now I feel my spirit breaking. Please, do not ask me for more than I can give.
Hamlet (speaking) My gifts are ashes and my words are wind. Take them or cast them to the dust, Ophelia, for nothing is left between us but ghosts.
Ophelia (thinking) The ache in my chest is a crushing tide. His face is strange and dear, all at once—a stranger in a familiar world. Let him see how I suffer.
Ophelia (speaking) I did not seek your gifts because I hungered for gold or sweet words. I sought you—your true self, the man behind the riddle. Now he is gone.
Hamlet (speaking) So be it. Let us bury what once was. I have nothing left to give—not even myself.
Ophelia (thinking) I cannot breathe. The room closes in; shadows press in corners where sunlight once lived. Is love always made to perish this way?
Ophelia (speaking) If there is a path back, I do not see it. Only the narrow way forward, alone. Forgive me.
Hamlet (speaking) Forgiveness is a word best saved for the dead.
Ophelia (thinking) I wordlessly extend the letters, the tokens—my hands trembling, heart hollow. He takes them, his fingers lingering on mine, a chill passing from him to me like a benediction turned curse. I have never felt more lost.
Ophelia (speaking) Farewell, Hamlet.
Hamlet (speaking) Farewell, sweet Ophelia. May you find more peace than I.
Ophelia (thinking) His eyes linger as I turn to go, parting us with a gaze more final than any door closing. I clutch my hands together to stanch the trembling, to hold in my sobs until I am alone. My chest is torn by what I have done, what I have had to do. Still, I force myself away.
Ophelia (speaking) (her voice barely above a whisper) The world is colder now.
Hamlet (speaking) Let it freeze, if love be so fragile.
Ophelia (thinking) The echo of his voice haunts me—wrath and heartbreak entwined. The future is a blank page, and I am inkless, wordless. My soul is stretched thin, fragile as ice on a winter pond.
Ophelia (speaking) (voice catching) There was once a garden, Hamlet. We walked there. The paths are overgrown now. I cannot find the way back.
Hamlet (speaking) The garden is gone, Ophelia. Let us not speak of it.
Ophelia (thinking) There were roses there, and hope. Now, only thorns.
Ophelia (speaking) (voice breaking) Then be well, my lord. I wish you no harm.
Hamlet (speaking) And I you. Remember, once, we were kind to each other.
Ophelia (thinking) If kindness could mend what is now torn, I would gather every thread. But some things, once broken, cannot be restored.
Ophelia (speaking) (turning, to herself) Mother, if you listen, guide me now. I am so very lost.
Hamlet (speaking) (to himself) Love is a shadow, fleeing in the dawn.
Ophelia (thinking) I will not cry. Not now. There will be time for tears when I am alone, when no one can see my shame. His gifts, now gone from me, leave a hollowness that pain cannot quite fill. I wonder if that emptiness will ever quiet.
Ophelia (speaking) (quietly) All things have their season. Our season is done.
Hamlet (speaking) (quiet, distant) Let the wind scatter our words as leaves.
Ophelia (thinking) The door closes softly behind me. My limbs ache with sorrow. The memories cling to my skin, cold and insistent. The future is all shadow and silence, and I must walk it alone. Each step feels heavier than the last, but it is my own.
Ophelia (speaking) (as if to a fading dream) Goodbye.
Hamlet (speaking) (alone now) She is gone. All is lost.
Ophelia (thinking) The world outside bathed in late sunlight seems to mock my darkness. The secret ache thrums behind my eyes—unshowable, unshareable. The echo of his voice, the feel of his gifts leaving my fingers, the weight of finality—they will haunt me. Let them. I have borne worse.
Ophelia (speaking) (to herself, voice trembling) I will survive this. I must survive.
Ophelia (thinking) No path is easy. Hearts break, and still the earth spins. I gather myself, torn and bruised, and walk on. This is not the end. 
Ophelia (thinking) The cold passes through my bones, but somewhere, in the farthest corner of my spirit, a small candle still burns. Even if all else is lost."

Ophelia (thinking)
His footsteps echo closer—a distant storm. I clutch his tokens in trembling hands, each one heavy with words that once swore love. What if he laughs? What if he weeps? Yet I must do this, I must sever the web before it strangles me, before his madness sweeps us both away. Let him see the pieces, I beg, let the weight pass back to him...
Ophelia (speaking)
My lord, I hoped to find you alone. Do not turn away—please. I beg your ear for but a moment. These... these letters, these gifts—tokens of kindness once—they burn my hands now. I cannot keep them. Would you take them back?
Hamlet (speaking)
Are you honest, Ophelia? What is this sudden trembling resolve that makes you come to me thus? Why now, when the memories live so newly in both our bloods?
Ophelia (speaking)
Honesty is all I have left, Hamlet. If I keep these, I betray myself and you too. I cannot be the shelter to your shadow. I return what is yours, not because I have ceased caring, not for want of remembrance, but because my father bids me so... and because your words—your eyes—in recent days have turned so cold. I do not know you, not as I did.
Hamlet (speaking)
My words, my eyes—Ophelia, do you think you know my heart so well? Have I not loved you with a fire to burn down all Denmark's winter? Tell me, did you not once swear to keep these—these poor tokens—as garlands for your soul?
Ophelia (speaking)
Once I did, beloved; but once is not always. The world shifts, and your sun has set behind black clouds. My father watches from the galleries—he doubts, he warns, he fears for his daughter’s virtue, for her mind. You see the danger in your own eyes, yet you speak as if nothing has passed between yesterday and today. I am afraid, Hamlet—of what you have become, of what I might yet become. I return your gifts to keep both our hearts clean.
Hamlet (speaking)
He instructs you—so it is his wish, not yours? Do you hold fast to his cloak, then, and not to the memory of us? Whose voice speaks with your tongue, Ophelia? Tell me truly, does your own heart command these cold hands to drive away what love once kindled?
Ophelia (speaking)
If you would only listen, Hamlet, you would hear how my heart shatters with every word. My father may command, but I obey because I must, not because I desire distance from you. You ask if these are my true wishes—how am I to know? For every beat is torn between love and duty, between your wild eyes and the world that shakes around us.
Hamlet (speaking)
You speak of the world as if it is some monstrous beast circling us—perhaps it is. I will not take these gifts back, Ophelia. Let them rot in your memory, or burn them, drown them, let them rest among willow branches in the brook. They are yours, for every word within was meant for you alone. I have nothing else to give, and nothing to reclaim.
Ophelia (speaking)
You wound me with that, Hamlet. I would not make sport of your affection, nor treat your gifts as so much refuse to be cast away. But I cannot bear their weight now. They seem to curse me—every glance feels watched, every tender memory is now a bruise. I beg you, if you have any mercy in you, relieve me of this burden.
Hamlet (speaking)
Relief, mercy—do these words mean anything in Elsinore? I am but a shadow in my father’s halls. I see ghosts behind pillars, treachery breathing through keyholes and you— you return what was once yours as if to say there is no place for my heart in your keeping. Is this the end you offer me? Is this all?
Ophelia (speaking)
No, not the end—never the end! But a door must close, perhaps only for a while, until clarity comes to both our hearts. My father paces in the corridor; he whispers poison, but I must heed him. I do not know who you are anymore, Hamlet—are you prince, lover, madman, or all at once? Your words twist the air, your gaze burns me. Please, take back what ties us, even for a night’s peace.
Hamlet (speaking)
If I am all those things, Ophelia, who are you to stand so far off, shivering in duty’s thin cloak? You say you fear what I have become—do you not see your own chains, the golden links of obedience tightening about your throat? Will you let them silence your own heart?
Ophelia (speaking)
Would that I could wield my heart as a blade! My hands tremble because I see the death of sweeter times—of moonlit vows, of letters written in hope. But hope is a fragile thing. The walls of this palace whisper secrets, and trust has become a stranger. I do not return your gifts to hurt you, my prince, but to save what remains of us—what memory cannot be spoiled or used against us.
Hamlet (speaking)
You speak as if you are already lost to me, Ophelia. As if we are both specters in this rotten state. Others listen; their ears press to these stones. Tell me, did your father set you this task, or do you plot, too, against the line of Denmark? Must I trust even you no more?
Ophelia (speaking)
Do not accuse me of such things! My love was never poison, never a plot! If my actions resemble betrayal, know it comes from a heart riven in two. Yours was the hand I yearned to hold until your words turned sharp, your mind sealed to me. I return these as a shield against those who would see us destroyed by rumors and doubts.
Hamlet (speaking)
Then shield yourself, Ophelia. Guard your heart well. But know this: you choose their counsel over my love, their protection over my madness. Let them comfort you in the nights to come, when you remember the warmth of my hand and the truth in my eyes before the darkness crept in. I will not abide by these rules set by frightened men.
Ophelia (speaking)
Frightened men rule this world, Hamlet! I am but their pawn, knocked between your kingdom and my father’s chamber. I did love you—may still love you, beneath the wounds and winter. But I must survive in this place, even if it means I must let you go. I am powerless, no sword to wield, only words to offer—empty, trembling, perhaps, but true.
Hamlet (speaking)
Survival—do you think that is living? Is your life so prized that you will bury every spark for the sake of another’s wish? If you must, then bury me, too, Ophelia. Let memory do its worst, for I am already forgotten by those I once trusted. Farewell, then. Take your peace with you, if peace can be found among such ruins.
Ophelia (speaking)
Peace is a stranger to me. I will carry your words as thorns, my lord. If memory turns cruel, let it be kinder than this moment. I did not wish for this sorrow. Take your tokens—please. Free me from this torment. I have no wish but for the world to unravel less around us both.
Hamlet (speaking)
The world will unravel, Ophelia, with or without our suffering. Give the tokens to the wind. Let the ghosts of this palace keep them. I have nothing to hold but shadows now.
Ophelia (thinking)
He leaves me empty as a winter branch, every syllable an icicle caught in my chest. The letters slip from my hand—petals torn in a storm. His voice lingers, a fading bell. Oh, for one clear note of what we were. But the world is as he said—a wheel splintering, a circle no word can close. I am alone. The gifts lie scattered. My heart aches for what cannot return.
Ophelia (speaking)
Goodbye, Hamlet. May the wind be kinder to you than Elsinore. Whatever hope remains, I lay it here, among your words and the silence that follows.
Hamlet (speaking)
There is no kindness in wind nor wall, Ophelia. Only memory, cold as stone. Go, then. Leave me to the shadows.
Ophelia (thinking)
It is done. The world stops spinning for a breath, and then the ache spreads anew. The air tastes of rain. His shadow lingers, but I must walk away, pulse by trembling pulse, until the stones grow silent to my weeping.
(Ophelia slowly backs away, the returned tokens crumpled in Hamlet’s unmoving hand. The air is tight with grief and unspoken words.)"
compliant and upset,"Ophelia returns Hamlet's gifts and letters, indicating the end of a romantic relationship.","The backdrop unfurls as Ophelia stands before Hamlet, holding in her trembling hands a small bundle of gifts and letters he once gave her, a silent sign that the intimate bond they shared has unravelled into heartbreak.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Every step I take toward him feels heavier—something between dread and duty presses inside my chest. The cool paper edges dig into my palm: every letter a memory, every trinket a promise he couldn’t keep. I want to be calm—dignified—but a wildness simmers under my skin, betrayed and raw. My father’s words echo in my mind: Do what must be done, Ophelia. Return them. End it. But what I want—what I ache for—clashes fiercely with what I must do. I see Hamlet’s face, searching, confused or perhaps already resolved. Am I the only one hurting here?
Ophelia (speaking)  
My lord, you know why I have come. These—these little things—are no longer mine to keep. They belong to you, Hamlet. I bring them back not with gladness, but with obedience. Every letter, every token—please, take them. The words you wrote once sounded sweet, but now…Now they only wound.
Hamlet (speaking)  
You…you bring me these back? Ophelia, what madness is this? What have I done, that you turn from me as if I am some foreign thing? You once cherished them—those words, those slight tokens—do you not remember? Has something poisoned your heart against me?
Ophelia (thinking)  
His confusion—real or feigned—strikes me like a sudden wind. He cannot know the force that pushed me to this. Please, Hamlet, do not make this harder. But my hands won’t stop trembling. I must speak truly, but I dare not betray my father’s command. Am I the villain in his eyes? Does he see my sorrow—or only his own?
Ophelia (speaking)  
No poison, my lord. No monster lurking in me but what grief can make. You gave these gifts with a gentle voice. Their sweetness lingered—once. But words can hollow out, Hamlet; gifts will lose their warmth. Or perhaps I never truly deserved them. Take them—let it be as if none of this ever was.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Never was? Is that what you wish, Ophelia—that nothing between us should mean anything?  
Or is this some test, some cruel trick set upon you by your father or your brother? You speak of duty, but what of love? Was your affection so fickle?
Ophelia (thinking)  
His words slice deeper than I want to admit. I want to cry out, I want to tell him the truth—that my heart aches, that this is not my desire but my burden. And yet—father’s advice knots my tongue. Loyalty to kin, loyalty to self, loyalty to him? Is it possible to hold all three, or will they tear me apart like wild dogs?
Ophelia (speaking)  
It is not for me to question duty, Hamlet. And if my love has wounded you, it was never meant to. But what more must I do? I bring back all you gave me; I bring back my own heart besides. There is nothing left.  
All I have now are memories, and those, too, I would return if I could.
Hamlet (speaking)  
You speak as if you’re already dead inside. Is it your father’s will, or your brother’s whisper? Have they pressed you so? Tell me, Ophelia—where is your own heart in all this tangled ruin?
Ophelia (thinking)  
Shadows gather behind me—my father, always watching, my brother’s warnings. Yet, in front, Hamlet, breaking open before me. He pleads for my own will. But do I even have any left? Or have I been so molded and reshaped by others’ desires that I hardly know what I wish for? The ache is overwhelming—my throat tightens with unshed tears.
Ophelia (speaking)  
My own heart is—lost, my lord. I have no words but these brittle ones.  
If you recall any kindness I ever showed, for heaven’s sake, take these gifts back and let me be.
Hamlet (speaking)  
If I take these gifts, Ophelia, what do I give you in return? Silence? Coldness? The end of what we were?  
Do you know what you are asking of me?
Ophelia (thinking)  
I did not come for more pain, but every word he speaks opens a new wound. Is there no way out of this for either of us?  
My father’s eyes perhaps spy from the arras. I must not betray him, must not betray myself, yet I want to reach for Hamlet—tell him everything, explain—if explanation would help. Could anything?  
I gather strength from somewhere, from the last reserves of dignity I have left.
Ophelia (speaking)  
You give me my freedom, Hamlet. Or something like it—a hollow, empty freedom, yes, but I must accept what fate allows me.  
Let us part without further cruelty.  
If ever I meant anything to you, if ever you spoke true, then accept this ending with grace.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Grace kills as surely as a knife. Very well, Ophelia. If you would have your freedom, I will grant it.  
But know this: love unreturned curdles inside, and these gifts—once innocent—now burn to touch.  
Yet I take them. From your hands, I receive both the tokens and the wound.
Ophelia (thinking)  
At last, he accepts them. The tiny weight lifted is nothing compared to the heaviness gripping my heart.  
Did I do what was right? Or only what I was told? My stomach churns—shame, pity, heartbreak, all knotted together. When did loving become so impossible?  
How I wish I could drop to my knees here and weep out every pain. But instead, I must remain upright—composed—cold, as they would wish me to be.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Thank you, my lord. I will trouble you no more.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Trouble me?  
Oh, Ophelia—if only you knew the storm inside me now. Go then, if you must. But remember—memory does not obey reason or command. It lingers, like a ghost.  
You are gone, but what we were is not so easily shorn.
Ophelia (thinking)  
My back aches from restraint. I feel the tears pushing fiercely behind my eyes, but I resolve not to give him—or the shadows that watch—my despair.  
If memory lingers, let it be so. Let him remember me with sadness; let him remember that I ended this not from lack of love, but from love’s impossibility.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Some things will linger, whether we want them to or not, Hamlet.  
May you find peace, though I cannot.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Peace? There is no peace in this. Only ashes where there once was fire.
Ophelia (thinking)  
His words echo in the space we once filled with laughter and hope. I have handed him back his gifts, but our wounds will not be so easily returned.  
My hands are empty now. Emptiness is its own kind of pain, sharp and real.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Farewell, Hamlet.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Ophelia—wait. Don’t…  
But you won’t stay, will you? You cannot.
Ophelia (thinking)  
The longing in his eyes is a mirror to my own.  
If I stay, I betray my father. If I go, I betray my heart.
Ophelia (speaking)  
No, Hamlet. I cannot stay.  
Goodbye.
Hamlet (speaking)  
Then I am undone. Go, if you must. Forget me, if you can.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I walk away—the ache is so enormous it might split me in two. Air feels thin, sharp. My fingers itch to reach back, but I force them steady at my side.  
Each step is a farewell.  
Was love ever really ours, or was it always meant to fall apart, piece by precious piece?
Ophelia (speaking)  
(her voice low, almost breaking)  
Let all be as it must.  
(then, gathering all the composure she can)  
Be well, Hamlet.
Hamlet (speaking)  
(voice echoing after her as she departs)  
To be well now is not for me.  
May your fate be kinder than you believe.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Tears finally fall—hot against my cheeks, as I escape the room where promises have come to die.  
Let no one see my breaking. Let everything I feel stay hidden, pressed between the last letter and the last regret.
Ophelia (speaking)  
(whispering to herself as she disappears)  
Let this ending be a mercy, if only time makes it so.
(Blackout. Silence settles; a love story ends not with rage but with sorrow—two souls left to wander, each carrying the weight of what could not be saved.)"
mad with grief,"Ophelia, driven insane by her father's death and Hamlet’s rejection, sings nursery rhymes and distributes imaginary flowers at court.","Ophelia, driven insane by her father's death and Hamlet’s rejection, sings nursery rhymes and distributes imaginary flowers at court.
Ophelia (thinking) There’s a cold stone somewhere that holds my father’s last breath. Every wall in this cursed court beats with a hollow sound. I can almost see the lies in the tapestries, hear the sorrow leaking from the cracks. My hands are empty, yet heavy with blooms that only I can see. I will give them away. I must—before all colour vanishes under the dust of grief.
Ophelia (speaking) There’s rosemary—that’s for remembrance, pray, love, remember, and there is pansies, that’s for thoughts. Here—take them, take them! Let the petals stick to your hands, sweet my lord; they will not wash away, not even with bitter tears.
Queen Gertrude (speaking) Gentle Ophelia, your mind is troubled. Why do you speak so? Your eyes do not see the world as it is. Let me comfort you, poor maid.
Ophelia (speaking) Comfort! Ha—comfort is in the earth, pressed down upon him! My father, my father! (She begins humming an old lullaby, voice skipping between melody and weeping.) You should wear some fennel for flattery, madam, and columbines for ingratitude. Take them, I plucked them for you at midnight while the moon clung to the willows. They grow in the cracks of broken oaths.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, look at me. See who stands before you. I am your brother—Laertes—returned to gather you safe in my arms. Speak! Say that you know me.
Ophelia (thinking) Laertes, dark-eyed and trembling, he’s come home to a place where the language is all wrong. No—he wants me to be calm, but there are thorns in my answers. The court is watching, their ears pointed like foxes.
Ophelia (speaking) Here are rue and daisies. Rue for repentance, and daisies for innocence. You need plenty of both, dear brother. Wear them close to your heart, lest it shatter. For you must choose—you must! Between bitter tears and forgetting.
Claudius (speaking) Her words stumble through nonsense and sense alike, but there is venom in the naming. Who has given her these weeds to scatter in our hall? Stop her, before her madness infects the very air.
Ophelia (speaking) No, my lord. You cannot bind the wind, nor pluck the wings from bees. I carry violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a fine grave—do you hear? A grave trimmed with rosemary and rue, and in it sleeps every true word ever spoken between a father and a daughter. (Her voice catches, and she giggles, a jagged sound.)
Queen Gertrude (speaking) Sweet Ophelia, give me your hand. Let me lead you from this gathering—a quiet room waits for you, far from curious eyes.
Ophelia (thinking) They keep wanting to spirit me away, as if silence were a balm. Let them try! My words will force the world to see, to listen. They must choke on these invisible flowers, these shreds of madness.
Ophelia (speaking) Do you see the garland? On my head, soft as a maiden’s vow. (She traces her forehead with trembling fingers.) But violets, sweet violets, all torn from the root. There is no faith left in Elsinore! I would sing you a song, madam, a song for the dead and the damned:
(she sings, almost whispering)
He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone;
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
Laertes (speaking) Enough! Cease this dreadful singing. You dishonor our father—can you not see it wounds me?
Ophelia (speaking) Wound me back, Laertes! There are poppies for pain and willow for forsaken love. I’ll give you both. Stick them close, brace your nerves—the water is deep with secrets. Father gone under, only bones now, and the water will not speak.
Claudius (speaking) Can none check her? These ravings unsettle the peace of our realm.
Ophelia (speaking) My lord, your peace is gilded; underneath, only dust and worm. I will sing louder, until my father hears me through the earth:
(she begins another melody, half-nonsense)
And with his shroud as the mountain snow…
Larded all with sweet flowers…
Which bewept to the grave did go
With true-love showers.
Queen Gertrude (speaking) Poor child—she hath gone utterly mad with grief.
Ophelia (thinking) Mad with grief—yes, let them say it! Grief is heavier than stone, sharper than winter’s blade. Madness is lighter—like petals caught on the river, spinning, spinning away. I am lighter now, floating above everything I have lost.
Ophelia (speaking) There’s a daisy for you—smile and smile and be a villain, they say. Daisies in your pockets, sirs and madams. Oh, Hamlet would have laughed at my flowers! Where is Hamlet? Gone to England, or to hell, or perhaps hiding behind the arras with a dagger drawn.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, yield to us, let us ease your suffering.
Ophelia (speaking) Ease? There is no ease. There is only hollow echo. Do you remember when we were children by the brook? I plaited crowns for you and called you king, and father laughed, so full of pride. The water glistens, Laertes. I see our childhood in its depths, but now it gapes for me, mouth wide, as if to swallow all memory.
Queen Gertrude (speaking) Her heart is breaking, every word a crack. We must send for a physician.
Ophelia (speaking) A physician cannot stitch the soul, madam. Nor give back what the knife has stolen. Here, for the Doctor: some rue, as bitter as a liar’s tongue and twice as sharp.
Claudius (speaking) Enough of this spectacle. Remove her. It gives the court a foul reflection—to allow such wailing in the halls of power.
Ophelia (speaking) Power! What is power when love is murdered in its sleep? Take your swords and your laws—see if they mend a broken heart, or hush the growls of vengeful ghosts. 
(suddenly turns to a lord trembling at the fringe)
And you—do you want a flower? I have only thorns left, but you may take them with my blessing.
Lord (speaking) Lady, you are unwell. I will pray for you.
Ophelia (speaking) Pray! Pray all you wish, the dead hear prayers, so does the river, and so do I. Will you pray for me, my lords and ladies? Or will you walk wide around my sorrow, afraid it clings? You cannot see them—the flowers, the scars. But still I give them away, a handful at a time.
Laertes (speaking) Oh, sister, your words are daggers. What must I do to reach you?
Ophelia (thinking) He cannot reach me where I have gone. How can I explain the shape of the ache within me? If only there were words for absence, for the outline left when love departs.
Ophelia (speaking) I will go sing to the river. The reeds are calling, and the reeds are kind. They do not mock or question. Let the water carry my songs to the stones, to my father, to Hamlet, to God. Farewell, my lords and ladies, keep your flowers—wear them, eat them, weep upon them. I shall make my own garland—of loss, of longing, of everything that has no name.
Queen Gertrude (speaking) Hold her! She must not wander from us!
Ophelia (speaking) (darting away, half-laughing, half-crying) Hold me if you can. But grief is quick—slippery as minnows, restless as my heart. I leave my flowers at your feet, invisible as my comfort, sharp as my sorrow. Lay them on my father’s grave, if ever you find true feeling.
Claudius (speaking) Madness poisons the court. See her gone. She must not spread this contagion.
Ophelia (speaking) Madness is honesty, laid bare. Your court is sick with secrets, but I—I am open as wounds. Let all look and see what pain is. Let none say I did not mourn, I did not love, I did not lose.
Laertes (speaking) Sister, please—know I love you. Whatever gods there are, let them have pity, for none here have shown enough.
Ophelia (speaking) Pity is a shallow comfort, Laertes. The water is deeper. 
(She turns away, singing under her breath—a child’s tune, twisted sad.)
Ophelia (thinking) None hold me. The court blurs. My hands are empty, full of flowers that never grew. My heart hurts enough for the world. I will go to the river, and let my grief drift far beyond reach—where nobody can pluck it, and nobody can see it, and it cannot bloom to sorrow anymore."
hopeless,Ophelia drowns in an apparent suicide.,"The willow branches trail in the dark water, and Ophelia, grief-stricken and alone, steps through the reeds as her pale dress soaks in the cold stream.
Ophelia (thinking) My mind is all hollow now, like a song a child forgets, and the light’s grown dull, blurred at the edges. If I could see Hamlet’s eyes once more, would hope return? The world is a ripple fading, and I am fallen out of it.
Gertrude (speaking) Ophelia? Child, where have you run off to? This is no place for mourning. Come away from the water; the evening chill will find you.
Ophelia (speaking) My lady, the river sings sweeter than any lullaby my mother knew. The leaves murmur, promising peace, and I am so very tired. I shall not trouble you nor the court any longer.
Gertrude (speaking) Do not talk so, Ophelia. You grieve for your father, but time will mend the heart. Your youth is not for sorrow, nor your hands for weaving garlands of woe.
Ophelia (thinking) Garlands—ay, for graves. He lies cold, and I feel nothing but the pull of the water. The world’s weight presses only unto me, not uplifting, not forgiving. What color is hope?
Ophelia (speaking) I have rosemary for remembrance, lady, and pansies—that’s for thoughts. Would you have a violet for faithfulness, or is that flower withered for all time?
Gertrude (speaking) Speak sense, dear child. Let us go back—let the maids draw you a bath, bring you supper. The king would not wish to see you thus unmoored.
Ophelia (speaking) The king… Ay, much good his wishes do me. His throne is built o’er coffins and betrayers’ bones. My father…my brother…all safe from the tide but me.
Gertrude (speaking) Your brother loves you, and returns from France even now. Trust that life remains for us—a dawn not yet broken.
Ophelia (thinking) Dawn? All is dusk, all is shadow. Laertes’ arms will not bear me up from under. I am not Ophelia—she has gone, trailing lilies behind.
Ophelia (speaking) You mourn for me, lady, but I am already lost. Oh, how heavy the quiet is: the world’s din faded down to the ripple and the sigh.
Laertes (speaking) Sister! What madness brings you to these banks alone? Where is your shepherd, your guardian? Tell me you are well.
Ophelia (speaking) Well? Ay, as the flowers are well, broken at the stem. Laertes, you have returned to ashes, to dust—nothing is left but water’s embrace.
Laertes (speaking) You speak riddles, my heart. Come hence; I beg you, take my hand. Grief’s madness is a passing storm—do not surrender to it.
Ophelia (thinking) I see his hand: strong, real, loving. But it cannot touch the hollow in me. When I look at the water, I do not see myself—I see peace. My heart pounds against my ribcage like a caged bird aching for release.
Ophelia (speaking) Laertes, did you know a bird will sometimes beat its wings until it dies for want of flight? We are not free, you and I—only at the end are we released.
Laertes (speaking) Stay, Ophelia! For Father’s sake, for mine—do not forsake us. Speak to me truly: what weighs upon you so leaden?
Ophelia (speaking) The world—weighs, brother. Words grown sharp and meaningless, the cold court with their hungry staring eyes, Hamlet’s love turned ragged and mad—nothing left for me. Maybe the river will take the burden, carry it away in eddies and weeds.
Laertes (speaking) No, O, no. You must not—life is brittle and answerless, but it bends. Let me bear your sorrow—a little longer, let me hold you in the light.
Ophelia (thinking) The light is far, and I am cold. My limbs ache, shivering with each breath; even his voice is distant, like thunder in another kingdom. I want the water—all its quiet, the silence wrapped deep below.
Ophelia (speaking) I have sung all my songs, brother. Let me sleep where the reeds cradle me, where memory drowns. There is no place for me in these stone halls.
Gertrude (speaking) Come, both of you. You must not linger in such shadowed company. This grief will pass, I promise you.
Ophelia (speaking) Promise? Lady, what is a promise? Words float, crack and scatter—petals torn from a dying flower. I have nothing left to promise nor believe.
Laertes (speaking) If you step there, the world will break. Ophelia, look at me. Remember: you are loved. You are not forsaken.
Ophelia (thinking) Love—like a thread worn thin. I want to believe—to see myself in their eyes, warm and living. But when I reach for them, my hands pass through emptiness, all substance washed away.
Ophelia (speaking) I beg you, let me go. The world’s grown too loud, too cruel. My mind—my heart—have become an echo only the water can answer.
Laertes (speaking) What of me? What of your brother and the memory of our father? If not for yourself, stay for us.
Ophelia (speaking) The river does not answer to memory or longing, Laertes. It merely takes and gives nothing. Like time, or kings, or love untrue.
Gertrude (speaking) She is fevered—delirious. Laertes, fetch the physician—quickly, before harm comes.
Ophelia (thinking) Harm—how strange that word. As though harm begins here, with wet stones instead of everywhere I’ve stepped since Father fell.
Ophelia (speaking) Do not chase me. Nothing remains to heal. The cold is gentle, after all—a mercy.
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia, please! Let me carry you back—let me shield you. You know not what you do!
Ophelia (speaking) I know better than any; I see clearer below the surface—the sky reflected there more constant than above.
(Laertes begins stepping gingerly into the marsh, careful not to slip.)
Laertes (speaking) Sister, do not! Think of Mother—of our childhood—of laughter in our father’s garden. Let those memories hold you. 
Ophelia (thinking) Laughter—a bird rising on clipped wings. All those springs ago, before death, before betrayal. If I close my eyes, I can almost hear it. But as soon as I look, it’s gone.
Ophelia (speaking) Memories are ghosts, brother. They watch but cannot speak, cannot shield me from the water.
Gertrude (speaking) Laertes, be gentle—she is not herself.
Ophelia (speaking) On the contrary, lady—I am most myself when I stand on the brink, feeling the world shrink to a thin singing in my chest.
Laertes (speaking) Don’t do this. I will not let you sink—I will hold you until the pain recedes.
Ophelia (thinking) I love him, truly. I wish I could let him save me. But the cold seeps and whispers. It’s gentle. It asks for nothing.
Ophelia (speaking) Forgive me, Laertes. For I cannot bear another day in borrowed sorrow. Remember me not with grief, but with the river’s hush and the willow’s shade.
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia! No!
Ophelia (thinking) My feet are numb. Stones roll soft beneath me. Water climbs, pulls my dress like loving hands. There is silence—even their voices dim.
Ophelia (speaking) Sing me to sleep, brother, as once you did beneath the boughs. Promise me you will not remember the sorrow—only the song.
Laertes (speaking) I cannot. Oh God, I cannot lose you!
Ophelia (speaking) Then let the river remember, and forget me not.
(The water swallows her voice. Laertes plunges towards her, shouting, his arms frantic.)
Laertes (speaking) Hold on, Ophelia! Sister, please! Do not leave me—not now, not like this!
Gertrude (speaking) Heavens, save her! Someone—help!
Ophelia (thinking) The world glows quiet, warm and soft inside the cold. I feel nothing now; the pain slips away, unknowing. Father—perhaps you wait for me below. The willow weeps as I fall, slow and gentle, the song ending… ending…
Ophelia (speaking) This is rest. This is peace I could never own above. Goodbye…
Laertes (speaking) Ophelia! No! No—no—
(The river’s current muffles all things; Ophelia’s eyes close. On the bank, Laertes collapses onto his knees, screams lost in the hush and toll of water.)
Gertrude (speaking) May angels carry her where we could not. Heaven hold thee, gentle maid.
Ophelia (thinking) Nothing remains. Only the hush, and the willow’s arms."
insane with grief,"Ophelia displays madness, singing old rhymes and bawdy songs while distributing imaginary flowers in court, devastated by her father's death and Hamlet’s rejection.","The court hangs heavy with tension as Ophelia wanders among the nobles, her mind fractured by her father's death and Hamlet's cruelty, her lips murmuring tangled rhymes as she scatters invisible blossoms.
Ophelia (thinking)  
They all watch me, faces so pale—do I frighten them, with my hands full of nothing but the air? Is Father hiding behind the heavy curtains, ready to jump and say this is all a play? But soft… no one comes.
Ophelia (speaking)  
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies, that’s for thoughts—don’t ask me what kind, my lord: they drift and scramble up the walls, all blue and yellow, a thousand little faces peering. Shall I tuck one in your cap, my Lady? For your sorrows. Sweet pansies, sweet thoughts.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Poor child, your words are strung on madness’s thread. Come, Ophelia, rest your pretty head.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Violets. Withered, are they not, since he did die? Father, oath-breaker, flower-plucker! Here—take fennel and columbines—bitter, bitter, but strong. Laertes, brother mine, do you hear your sister? Take rue, for you, and some for me; we may call it the herb of grace o' Sundays. You may wear your rue with a difference.
Laertes (speaking)  
Dear Ophelia, speak no more in riddles! You kill me with your wildness. My sister, speak plain!
Ophelia (thinking)  
Plain as light through water—plain as stones in a river. The water is over my head and the stones tickle my feet.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Oh, you must sing, brother, the old songs—do you remember when we wound daisies in our hair and made garlands for the lambs?  
(singing, voice trembling and bright)  
“How should I your true love know  
From another one?  
By his cockle hat and staff,  
And his sandal shoon—”
King Claudius (speaking)  
She rambles, let her be removed; this is sorrow turned poison.
Ophelia (speaking)  
No, my most sage and secret-keeping King—here’s a daisy for you, too! Not for love, not for faith, but for dissembling. Wear it close to your heart if it be not too hard a thing. Is there any honesty left in Elsinore, or only torn petals scattered on the stones?
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Dearest, still your tongue—your grief overmasters sense.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Sense? What sense in graves yawning? Here’s rue, Queen, bitter tears mingled with perfume. Mother's bones sleep under willow trees—no, she's here, she's not—perhaps all mothers live with the river reeds. “He is dead and gone, lady, he is dead and gone;  
At his head a grass-green turf,  
At his heels a stone.”
Laertes (speaking)  
Sweet sister, your mind wanders with your feet. Take my hand, stay—be still.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Stay—still—still as my Father’s hands, curled around no blessing. Hamlet! My heart aches in the place where you touched it.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I remember the young man who spoke of poppies and violets, who pressed roses to my lips and called me his own. He’s vanished—weep, all of you! Weep for lost crowns and lost loves.  
Oh, my lord, the world is unpinned, coming apart—“Larded with sweet flowers;  
Which bewept to the grave did go  
With true-love showers.”
King Claudius (speaking)  
Take her from here, she disturbs the peace of our sorrow.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Peace? Do you call this peace?  
(singing, shrill and soft all at once)  
“Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,  
All in the morning betime,  
And I a maid at your window,  
To be your Valentine.”  
Did you not come down, my lord, to open the window and bid the birds sing? Did you not promise forever? Lies ring louder than bells. Nurse, I have a flower for you too—oh, but it shrivels in my palm, just like my hopes.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Let her be, let her be—I will not see her bound or roughly handled. In sorrow all of us are kin.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Oh, sweet lady, your soft hands would stroke a fever from my brow—shall I give you rue for Sundays? Or rosemary for remembrance? “Pray you, love, remember…”  
But what to remember? The sound his neck made, or the silence afterward?
Laertes (speaking)  
What song is this? Tell me, Ophelia—where lies our father?
Ophelia (speaking)  
In the ground, ground, ground—“White his shroud as the mountain snow.”  
Father is sleeping, dust for a pillow, grass for a coverlet. The worms will croon him lullabies, and the stars will sew his new coat.  
(blinking, turning to the courtiers)  
Who’ll buy my flowers? All are gone, but the air is thick with their smell—a little hope, a sprig of grief, a crown of madness. Cheap as love, dear as death.
King Claudius (speaking)  
This girl brings omens—her tongue is a net of dangers.
Ophelia (speaking)  
And who will net the fishes when the river bursts its banks? I saw my face in the water and it smiled back, all broken pieces. Who will gather me together when I fall apart?
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, come—come from the shadows. This grief will swallow you whole.
Ophelia (thinking)  
I'd let it. I'd step into the dark if only it were warm. Not like his voice that cracked and froze me still.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Do you see me, all of you? Or am I only a shadow walking through your dreams?  
(singing, low and fierce)  
“They bore him barefaced on the bier—  
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny—  
And in his grave rained many a tear:—Fare you well, my dove!”
Laertes (speaking)  
If love can cure, sister, I would give you all of mine. Return, return from the edge.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Love? I’ll find love in the river, floating with the rushes. I’ll pluck my wedding from the mud.  
(sudden laughter, wild)  
Come dance, brother! The world is sharp on my tongue, but my feet remember sweet ground.  
“Before you tumbled me  
You promised me to wed—”  
Would Hamlet keep his promise, were he here? Would any man?
King Claudius (speaking)  
Enough, enough! Take this mazed girl from my halls.
Ophelia (thinking)  
What have I done but give them truth in flowers? Cruel truth, but softer than knives.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I will go, my lord, when the lilies lead me. My song will stay here, echoing against these empty thrones.  
“By Gis, and by Saint Charity,  
Alack, and fie for shame!  
Young men will do’t if they come to’t;  
By cock, they are to blame.”
Queen Gertrude (speaking)  
Cover her, let no wind chill her—her grief is a madness we all share.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Share it, drink it, drown in it—all of you! I have no more flowers.  
(singing, faint and broken)  
“And will he not come again?  
No, no, he is dead,  
Go to thy death-bed,  
He never will come again.  
His beard was as white as snow,  
All flaxen was his poll:  
He is gone, he is gone,  
And we cast away moan—  
God ha’ mercy on his soul!”  
And on all Christian souls, I pray—God be wi’ you.
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia! Wait—do not go alone.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Alone—or always surrounded? The river calls, brother. The grass bends. The sky turns—Father waits.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Stars blink out, and I am lighter than the earth. Hamlet left no promise, only green weeds around my heart. If I sing loud enough, perhaps the world will shatter and let me through.
Ophelia (speaking)  
When you next see me, bring a shroud of poppies, and a garland of willow—let the songs float after me, like petals in the stream. Farewell—my feet are flowers too.  
(she drifts, humming to herself, passing into the dusk beyond the court, her mind caught in tides of hope and ruin)"
hopeless,Ophelia drowns in an apparent suicide.,"The willow branches droop over the murky bank, their shadows licking at the hem of Ophelia’s trembling dress as she stands at the water’s edge; her limbs hang heavy, and her eyes are red-rimmed, distant, empty.
Ophelia (thinking)  
They are all gone. My father lies in the cold dirt with worms for company; my love wears madness as his only crown. Who now will call me dear? Who now will pluck the burrs from my hair? I feel it inside me—like the water’s slow invasion. Even the sky has turned its eyes away.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, child, what draws you to these banks so far from the castle? Your gown is soaked with dew and your cheeks flush with fever—come back inside.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Mother, do you see them? The violets and long purples—dead in my fingers before I began to weave. The river is gentler; she will not scold if I let them fall.
Gertrude (speaking)  
There is a sorrow that speaks louder than reason, Ophelia. We cannot fix what has broken, but you—come, let me hold you.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Her hands have never known comfort. She cannot fix what’s broken—no one can. Hamlet’s words still sting beneath my skin: “Get thee to a nunnery.” His love left marks gentler than his madness. I will not cry. There are no tears left.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister! Ophelia, answer me. Why do you stand waist-deep in reeds and shadow? I looked for you in every hall. Speak to me, little bird.
Ophelia (speaking)  
You would not know me now, Laertes. The swallow that slept on your wrist has flown. Father is lost. Your arms cannot reach across that grave.
Laertes (speaking)  
He was murdered, Ophelia. I vow I shall make them suffer. There will be justice.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Justice is a pale flag waving above mud and bone. Father’s mouth opens: silence. Hamlet’s mouth closes: poison. And I—what is left, when men’s vows wrap the world in war and blame? I am not made for wrath.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Laertes, nothing’s left but brambles and the river. Will you sing me a song? The one of the wild rose lost at sea. 
Laertes (speaking)  
Not here, Ophelia. Not in this narrow place. Come back to stone and candlelight. Let my hands bring you home.
Ophelia (thinking)  
Even home is not home. All is changed. I can feel the silt clutching my heels; the current begs me down. There is room in the river for loneliness.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I am tired, Laertes. The bones in my arms are made of willow wood. My heart is water. There is no shore for me.
Laertes (speaking)  
No, sister, you are not alone. I am returned. I will not let you be swept away.
Ophelia (thinking)  
He is too far above me, on unbending earth. I am damp reeds and hidden roots. I cannot climb.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Look—she shivers. Laertes, go fetch the nurse, quickly! Ophelia, what plagues your spirit so that you would turn away from those who love you?
Ophelia (speaking)  
Love is a mask we wear until it slips and shows the emptiness underneath. All things empty, all things sink.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Do not talk so. We shall mend you—sweet, foolish girl. This will pass, you shall see.
Ophelia (thinking)  
“Pass.” They do not know that sorrow is a stone pressed to the chest, each day heavier than the last. Their voices cannot meet me here, in the cold hush between reeds. I am not mad, only emptied.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Mother, will you remember me as I am now, or as I was when I laughed and ran in the orchard?
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia, I see only your sadness now. But I remember, yes—I remember the peals of your laughter, your small hands full of apples.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Then hold that as the truth of me, and let the rest slip beneath the water. The river remembers nothing.
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister, please—take my hand. Let me hold you one moment longer. What frightens you so?
Ophelia (thinking)  
No hand can draw back a life already let go. My fear is a great wind blowing through hollows. His hand would be warm—he means well. But warmth cannot anchor what floats untethered.
Ophelia (speaking)  
The water looks peaceful, does it not? Yet below, the current tugs and twines—quick as the flick of a trout’s tail. How lucky, to fall and simply vanish. No more questions.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Come away from there, Ophelia! This is madness. If you do not care for yourself, at least remember those who want you still.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Do you? When the echoes fade, when the stones forget my footprints? I am already vanishing. The world closes around my absence like ripples.
Laertes (speaking)  
Ophelia, don’t speak so—your words are colder than the river. I will not lose you. I will drag you from the water with my own hands if I must.
Ophelia (thinking)  
He cannot reach what is already half-drowned. His voice trembles. I am past trembling, past holding on.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Laertes—be brave for me, as I am not. Tell Father I tried to be gentle. Tell Hamlet I forgive him, though his words were daggers.
Gertrude (speaking)  
She leans too close—Laertes, hurry!
Ophelia (thinking)  
My mind is quiet now. The roar is past. My feet grow colder—the river calls me Ophelia as no one else can. I step deeper; the water laps at my hips, as if to soothe. Let the world above rage and clamor: here is only hush.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Goodnight, sweet princes. Goodnight to violets and rosemary, to all that ever bloomed and then went to sleep.
Laertes (speaking)  
OPHELIA! 
Ophelia (thinking)  
The willow bends low, a mourning mother. The sun loses its grip as I lose mine. My hair floats, pale banners in the water. My hands are empty. I am heavy and light, sinking and flying all at once. Somewhere, Father waits, or no one waits. The river knows my secrets, and keeps them.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I am Ophelia. Remember me only in spring, and let winter have all the rest.
Gertrude (speaking)  
She slips beneath—Laertes! The water! Ophelia!
Laertes (speaking)  
No, no, no—give her back! Ophelia! Grab her gown! 
Ophelia (thinking)  
It is quiet, here below. Light shivers on the surface, a blurred sky. Breath is a memory turning to silver. It is not fear—a release, a letting go. My fingers loose the flowers—they tumble upward, pale ghosts. The current is kind, in its own way. I close my eyes and drift, knowing no voice will reach me now.
Ophelia (speaking)  
I forgive. I forget. I go.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Ophelia! Hold on, sweeting—please, keep your head above the water!
Laertes (speaking)  
She does not answer—she’s so pale—
Ophelia (thinking)  
I do not hear them. I do not hear the world. The river rocks me, gentle as a cradle. I float between what was and what might have been. My body drifts, but my sorrow stays tethered to the roots above.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Sleep, sleep, sleep—
Gertrude (speaking)  
Come back! Do you hear me?
Laertes (speaking)  
Give me your hand, Ophelia! Don’t go, don’t go!
Ophelia (thinking)  
Hands reach, voices from far away. I am neither here nor there. Below, the weeds entangle, silken as lullabies. Time unspools.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Let it end. Let it end kindly.
Gertrude (speaking)  
Sweet child, may angels sing thee to thy rest. 
Laertes (speaking)  
Sister! I am sorry—oh, I am sorry.
Ophelia (thinking)  
No more ache. No more fear. Only drifting. The water finds my cheek, cool as understanding. The world unknots. I loved too much, and knew too little, and now I am gone, and it is soft, soft, soft.
Ophelia (speaking)  
Goodbye.
The ripples close; the river hushes. Ophelia’s flowers float where she vanished, a silent elegy spun by the circling current."
mad with grief,Ophelia puts on a display of singing nursery rhymes and bawdy songs while handing out invisible flowers at court.,"The grand court glimmers with candlelight and anxious faces as Ophelia, wild-eyed and haggard, dances through the assembled lords and ladies, singing old nursery rhymes and ribald tavern songs, pausing to hand invisible flowers to one horrified courtier after another.
Ophelia (thinking)
They flinch and murmur—how pale their faces are, all powdered and painted with worry, not with love! If only he saw me now, if only Father could return for a single, gentle touch—no, the world is breaking, like mother's porcelain cup. The water in my mind is rising.
Ophelia (speaking)
How should I your true love know from another one? By his cockle hat and his staff, and his sandal shoon. He is dead and gone, lady, he is dead and gone; at his head a grass-green turf, at his heels a stone!
Gertrude (speaking)
Sweet Ophelia, what means this music? Ophelia, look at me—your Queen entreats you, put up your song and come sit beside me. These riddles frighten all.
Ophelia (thinking)
Sit, she says, as if sitting could make sense again. The Queen—her hands are soft but colder than Hamlet's silence. There's motes dancing in the sunlight, enough to weave a shroud.
Ophelia (speaking)
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray, love, remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts. Oh, pansies—purple and shaking, just like the ones near the water. Will you take them, Madam?
Ophelia (speaking)
And there's fennel for you, and columbines; there’s rue for you, and here’s some for me. Oh, we may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays; you may wear your rue with a difference!
Laertes (speaking)
Sister! What is this? Why do you give what your hands do not hold? Our father is fresh in earth, and here you scatter ghosts among us.
Ophelia (thinking)
Laertes, gentle brother, how the sea rides behind your eyes. I pluck at the air, nothing in my fingers but memories—Father’s grave, the hollow in Hamlet’s voice. Perhaps if I give away the last of me I will vanish, too.
Ophelia (speaking)
There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end—oh, but the end is always wet, and the windows don’t open.
Claudius (speaking)
Let her be. Grief drives the wisest mad, and we must give her space. But Ophelia, sweet maid—do you remember your courtly manners? This is not a place for old song.
Ophelia (speaking)
Sing willow, willow, willow. The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, sing all a green willow. Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee—sing willow, willow, willow.
Courtiers (speaking)
(whispers ripple and grow) Sweet saints, is she cursed? Can any doctor save her? She seeks flowers where none grow! Her beauty runs to wildness.
Ophelia (thinking)
My throat aches, longing for the sound of Father’s voice or Hamlet’s—something solid. No one answers, nothing answers. I’ll show them: I can out-sing grief, unwind it like a ribbon.
Ophelia (speaking)
Let’s have a dance! Who will tread a measure? Who remembers love’s first primrose, or the place where secrets hide? Here’s a flower for you, my lord, blue as heaven and bitter as death—hold fast before it flies.
Lord Polonius’s Chair (empty, silent)
Ophelia (thinking)
Father, would you scold me? Would you hush this song or tie my apron once more? The shadows have teeth tonight.
Ophelia (speaking)
They bore him barefaced on the bier, they set him down with black; a shroud as white as mountain snow, and all the loud bells knelled, m’alack! Oh, ’twas a sweet day never, when my father died.
Gertrude (speaking)
Poor child, her heart is split. Someone fetch her nurse—Ophelia, stay with us! Speak plainer—has Hamlet spoken cruel to you? Or does your sorrow come from other hands?
Ophelia (speaking)
Hamlet? He made me promises once—gilded words of forever, drawn like daggers in the dark. I have known what it is to wait with trembling hands and dream of golden days that never dawn. For love is a songless bird now, curled small in the hollow of my ribs.
Laertes (speaking)
I will see Hamlet called to answer for this. The prince has loosed misery upon us all! Sister, I swear to avenge—
Ophelia (speaking)
Vengeance? What will you cut—the air, the river’s mirror? Would you fish for me among the reeds? Oh, brother, do you remember the pond where we played, chasing frogs? I found a frog today, but it sang like a child. There’s rue for you—too much for any grave.
Claudius (speaking)
Enough! She soils this room with riddles. The court is unsettled—see how men pale, hearing her wrack and rhyme. Ophelia, I order you to be silent!
Ophelia (thinking)
Order? His tongue is a serpent’s, writhing under the crown—it hisses in my ear, but I am deaf now. My grief rings louder than any king’s comfort.
Ophelia (speaking)
Oh, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown! I wore my best ribbon for him, and now the wind unravels it. Come, sir, here’s rosemary, and one last violet for the traitor king. Don’t you see it? It’s the color of forgiveness—but so very faint.
Gertrude (speaking)
Gentle Ophelia, do not rail at the throne. The king has shown you kindness—you are alone, but you must not be wild.
Ophelia (speaking)
Wild? Wild is the river, madam, the riverbanks breaking, the world washing away. Do you hear the water calling, calling my name, soft with secrets?
Courtier 1 (speaking)
Her words chill me—see the tears on her robe! She is witched or else undone by sorrow.
Laertes (speaking)
Ophelia, come with me. The hour is late, and you have scattered enough phantoms in these halls.
Ophelia (speaking)
I cannot gather what I do not own. All that’s left is water, and willow, and the music of absence. Tell me—when the morning bells ring, will you remember me, Laertes?
Laertes (speaking)
Every hour I shall, dear sister, but you must rest. I beg you.
Ophelia (thinking)
Perhaps rest is found where the lilies float and the sky drowns in ripples. What is rest to a mind adrift? They wish to contain me, to press me into silence—but my soul unlaces itself, pouring out like the water that stole away Father.
Ophelia (speaking)
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day, all in the morning betime, and I a maid at your window, to be your Valentine. Then up he rose and donned his clothes and dupped the chamber door—let in the maid, that out a maid never departed more.
Courtier 2 (speaking)
Such scandalous verse! Why does no one hush her, for decency’s sake?
Gertrude (speaking)
Let her grieve in her own tongue. Sorrow must have words, even if sense is lost.
Claudius (speaking)
See her whisk past us, skipping like a shadow. Mark my words—her madness seeds unrest. Send for her kin, confine her if you must!
Ophelia (speaking)
Here’s a song for you, good lords, and here’s a wreath of nothingness. Catch it, if you can! (sings, soft and wild) And will he not come again, and will he not come again? No, no, he is dead—go to thy death-bed. He never will come again. His beard as white as snow, all flaxen was his poll. He is gone, he is gone—and we cast dust upon him.
Ophelia (thinking)
I taste salt—tears, or the memory of the sea? Fingers too light, head too heavy; they stare as though I am already part ghost. Flowers are all that remain, though I hold only air.
Ophelia (speaking)
God be wi’ ye, good ladies. God be wi’ ye, good gentlemen. Remember me in your prayers, where the bells ring hollow. There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance. Farewell.
Laertes (speaking)
Stay, Ophelia! Wait—someone seize her! She cannot simply vanish…!
Ophelia (thinking)
I dance away on tiptoe; the world rushes behind me, clamoring and cold. Grief tongues my heels and hounds me onward, but in the river, perhaps, the lilies will close above, and the songs will sleep."
hopeless,Ophelia drowns in an apparent suicide.,"The banks of the river are heavy with willow, and the air hangs dense with the weight of lost promise as Ophelia slips silently into the water—her drowning an apparent act of final surrender.
Ophelia (thinking)
The sunlight weeps as it touches the river. How cold a comfort, this reed-woven solitude, this hush of leaves above my head. I hear the world in echoes, each sound drifting farther from me, muffled by a heavy moss of sorrow. My heart aches and aches and no salvation comes to cradle it.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)
Ophelia, child, why sit you by the river’s edge so long, in such muddy silence? The castle grieves. Your father lies cold, Polonius gone—but there are those who would hold you, sweet girl. Why do you not return?
Ophelia (speaking)
Lady, you wear hope in your voice, yet to my ears all comfort sounds like the sigh of the stream as it drags me. You speak of holding and of hands, but those who loved me hold daggers or drift ghosts. My father does not answer.
Ophelia (thinking)
What words turn the tide? None, for I am a pebble, carried where currents will. Still I listen, polite, though I know the river knows me now much better than any court. Better than Hamlet, who hid his face behind his riddles and left me empty-handed.
Laertes (speaking)
Sister, what do you do? Your feet are bare, dress muddied at the hem. Mother says you wander and mutter songs that twist with the wind. Hear me—look at me, Ophelia. Please. You are not alone, not while I breathe. I will avenge our father, cherish you as he did—just come away from the water, Ophelia. The banks are treacherous.
Ophelia (speaking)
Dearest brother, your voice comes faint, as though through mist. Yet your words are strongest of all—iron wrapped in velvet. I have listened for justice in every footstep. I have peered behind every arras. Where is the peace you promise? Where is the warmth, the comfort of things that were, before blood muddied everything?
Ophelia (thinking)
He loves me so well, my brother, fears for my mind even as his own goes to war. But the world is shorn of sense. I cannot trust in vengeance; justice is smoke that slips always from my hands. No one returns what was stolen from our hearth.
Hamlet (speaking)
Ophelia? Do you remember laughter? Do you remember flowers pressed between pages, petals ne’er torn by grief? There was a time—and perhaps it was a mistake, but I once believed our love could withstand rot and ruin. I was wrong. The rot is within us. Within me. Forgive me what I have become.
Ophelia (speaking)
Forgive, forgive—how easy, yet how endless the asking. Your words flutter like moths about the lantern of my mind, Hamlet. They find neither flame nor rest. I loved you once with a heart unschooled in sorrow, but the lessons are well-learned. What use is forgiveness when love itself is a ghost?
Ophelia (thinking)
His eyes are empty wells. He was once all fire and brightness, but now even his shadow bites cold. The hope I once wore as a garland has snapped, and every petal found its grave beneath my window. How dearly I would rest with them.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)
Child, if not for you, then for your father, for the memory of the gentle man who cradled you for so many evenings. The halls are too silent now. Come in—let the castle hold you. Let its walls keep you from the wind.
Ophelia (speaking)
Too silent, yes. The hush is a chasm, Lady. Within its depths, I hear my father’s voice, not as comfort but as echo. His absence roars. The castle with all its stone cannot defend against what creeps within the bones. Let me sit by my river. Here the stones speak as softly as he once did.
Ophelia (thinking)
Would that I could answer as Gertrude wishes, pick up my skirts, dust off the mud and pretend the world is as it used to be. But my feet will not carry me back to halls haunted by memory. Here, at least, the water keeps counsel and the songs of the birds are not lies.
Laertes (speaking)
That is not true, Ophelia—come away with me. We can start anew, we can grieve together and build something from these shreds of sorrow. Please. The water can never love you as we do. It has no mind for the living.
Ophelia (speaking)
You hope, and you plead, and I feel the seams of my heart stretch and strain for you, Laertes. Yet, I am already half-song, half-shadow. Where you see a beginning, I see only the winding, winding river, and the pull to be gone. I am already too far for rescue.
Ophelia (thinking)
His sorrow laces with mine, binding me, holding me at the very edge, but the weight is too much. The world tilts, and I slide, gentle as the willow’s leaf into the hands of water.
Hamlet (speaking)
You are not forsaken, Ophelia. I am fractured, yes, and damned by my actions, but somewhere in the splinters, I keep your memory—your sweetness, your songs. If you leave, my soul will find no rest. You are the last strand that tethers me.
Ophelia (speaking)
A heavy tether indeed, Hamlet. If I am your last strand, know that it frays with every sigh. My songs are gone—left on the tongue but absent in the heart. Keep your memory; let it anchor you if it can. Give me your blessing to depart, or at least leave me silence.
Ophelia (thinking)
So many want to keep me—hold me for their healing, for their absolution. None listen for the hollow in my chest, the cold slithering in where love once lived. I am tired even of weeping; only the river weeps for me now.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)
Ophelia, listen: I have lost a son and gained only more sorrow. I see the storm behind your eyes, child. Do not believe the water will soothe it. Storms cannot love—only bruise, only break. Stay.
Ophelia (speaking)
Your kindness is the last soft thing left in me, Lady, but the storm is mine. I cannot set it aside nor pass it on. We are taught to carry burdens, taught to smile beneath them. I have smiled and carried and bled beneath their weight. There is nothing more left for me to bear or break.
Ophelia (thinking)
Each breath draws water-scent. Ferns curl beside me, green and unknowing, yet their roots are strong—they hold on. I envy them. My own roots were pulled long ago, and I have drifted ever since, swirling toward emptiness.
Laertes (speaking)
Stay, Ophelia. If you will not grant me your hand, at least promise me your song. Sing, as you did when we chased butterflies, when the world was new and pain was still a distant shore. Sing, and I will hold you, if even for a moment.
Ophelia (speaking)
A song? Once I had hundreds—all light and blue sky. Now they turn to salt upon my lips. Yet, for you, Laertes, I will try:
[sings, voice weak, trailing]
“He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone,
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone…”
(narrative break as her voice falters, watery and thin)
Ophelia (thinking)
My voice shivers, lost among rushes. Each word is a stone on my chest, each note a ripple circling outward, never returning home. They listen and cannot reach me. I am a melody sinking.
The water beckons with its cool, gentle hands. The world recedes—sharp edges gone, only hush and flow and the distant ache of absence.
Hamlet (speaking)
Ophelia… Stay with me. Speak again—one word is all I ask. Do not slip away into silence.
Ophelia (speaking)
I gave you all my words, Hamlet. I gave you petals and laughter and love’s clear water. But you poured them away as carelessly as stones in your pockets. I have no words left, only the river’s song.
Ophelia (thinking)
His pleas are hollow shells. I wish, oh god, I wish I could answer differently, but truth wells up uncontrollable and drowns every hope. The river is so close now—if I lean forward, I will fall, vanish, become nothing but silt and memory.
Queen Gertrude (speaking)
Ophelia, child, look to me—my arms, my voice, my own grief. We can share it, soften it, wrap ourselves together and outlast this darkness. Do not give the river what we cannot recover.
Ophelia (speaking)
You are kind, milady, but kindness is not enough—a hand cannot mend all that has unraveled. I have nothing left to lose, only a heart too tired for more breaking. Let me go with the river; let it carry me where pain cannot follow.
Ophelia (thinking)
I feel the water touch my feet—sly, cold, welcoming. There is a peace in surrender, a hush beneath the current that promises rest. No more pleading, no more waiting—simply the gentle rocking, the final, soft embrace.
Laertes (speaking)
Then take all my love, sister. Take every prayer I have. Wherever you drift, know I will search every stream for your song.
Ophelia (speaking)
Goodnight, sweet brother. May flights of angels sing you to your rest. Forget me, if you can, or remember me only as the girl who gathered flowers, who loved and was loved, before sorrow drowned it all.
Ophelia (thinking)
There, now. The river closes around me, cool arms cradling my bones. Above, the sky wavers, willow branches trailing in silent testament. I am gone, washed away—a flicker in the current, sorrow turned to silence. At last, perhaps, I may dream without waking."
