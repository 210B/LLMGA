I am told even the ghosts of Hamlet’s kin must knock thrice to be permitted such revels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lily, do not make of me a figure for thy merriment.

But is it not said transparency is virtue’s own shield? You must be privy, then, to the Scottish lairds’ custom of training messenger hawks, their eyes painted with the likeness of their masters to recall home.

I heard such things heal even the deepest wounds—a king’s wisdom distilled into sweetness."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No more fancies! Had I powers to cure sorrow with honey, my nephew would be merry and my halls untroubled by moans.

Norway’s threats are known to me, as are the tempests that stir in Fortinbras’ blood. As to Hamlet… he walks the line ‘twixt genius and madness.

Forgive me, but I must confess—word nears me on the wings of the wind that you have at last mastered Hamlet’s little iron pigeon. What a wonder! The very marvel of the court, they say. Did it not peck at Lord Polonius’ boots just last night? I warrant, you keep these amusements for yourself and young prince alone. Is there a meaning to it all—do you meet in secret, plotting flight across the sea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lady Lily, you do entertain the court’s fancies with a master’s tongue. An iron pigeon? These are illusions bred of idle heads and late-night drink. Young Hamlet is much given to toys and schoolboy jests, but I, a man encumbered with the yoke of Denmark, have neither hour nor heart for such diversions. No bird of metal nor winged mischief shall take me from my kingly cares. If Polonius hath met with any pigeon—iron or else—I shall have words with him on the matter. Now pry not further, or you’ll be chasing peacocks in the moonlight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, Your Grace! Is my tongue too swift? Blame not a simple soul curious for mysteries. The contraption is the least: what truly sets the candles flickering are tales that you, sweet Claudius, teach Hamlet old star-charts by the window—saying that Sirius pours wisdom into men’s ears, or that Jupiter scolds the unkind king. And then—ah, you must forgive the kitchen boys, for they swore upon the saints that they saw Your Highness passing to the prince a disc of bread, crowned with scarlet fruit and green herb, which Hamlet called “pizza.” Tell me—do you dabble in astrology, or bake forbidden pies at midnight, my Liege?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lady Lily, thou art light-tongued beyond measure, and near impertinent. If every servant’s fancy were given voice, this court would ring with talk of dragons, mermaids, and men who fly upon bread! Hamlet is a scholar: he fills his mind with all manner of foreign tongue and nonsense—star-charts, pizza, whatever madness infects the modern youth. As for me, am I a baker, that you accuse me? A king with flour on his brow, or tomatoes beneath his ring! Mind yourself, lest rumor twine itself about your brow and choke true sense from you. I do not brook such mockery, however slyly it’s dressed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Dear King, how sharp your words, though droll enough to slice a loaf! Would you wound one for seeking to know? I wonder, Majesty, what else Elsinore’s stones might tell if they had ears—perhaps of spectral birds returned from the grave, piping secrets from the other world, or of queens who taste of hidden recipes by lamplight. Some say the iron pigeon is the work of a conjurer Hamlet befriended at university—a man with clockwork in his veins, who could make miniature goats dance a minuet. Is it not odd? Yesterday Hamlet told Laertes the pigeon sings when fed a crystal pebble. Such tricks! But if only Hamlet, Laertes, and my king keep such council, what should the rest of us think? Are we unworthy of the future?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Enough, Lily! Your tongue wags on as foolishly persistent as a jester’s bell. You trade in shadows and sculpt mischief from air. No iron pigeon, no crystal pebble, no alchemical goat shall dictate the business or destiny of Denmark. I have said plain: Hamlet toys with nonsense, and I am too burdened with the weight of the crown to nurse childish amusements or parley with university warlocks.

Might it be the strain of arranging the next masquerade ball with the Swedish Prince? I've heard no such commotion since you and Yorick were plotting entertainments at court. Surely, with friends so jovial and close to your heart, the burdens of kingship cannot weigh so heavily? \\ But, I do wonder, did Yorick ever teach you those intricate juggling tricks I hear you two practiced in the west tower? Or is it true that, more recently, you have consulted physicists from Florence on the movement of the celestial orbs, hoping to bring a great mechanical lion to Elsinore’s feasts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lily, thou hast a lively tongue and a mind prone to far flights. Yorick, whose skull now rests with the worms, was my brother’s jester—never have I been one for tumbling, nor did I stoop to juggle with that merry soul.

Such tales abound in the servants’ hall; surely a king knows how to keep his secrets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Enough! These are idly spun cobwebs, Lily. I am no poet, nor did I ever set pen to parchment for any foreign lady, least of all a ghostly harpist conjured by your fancy.

And did the nightingale really sing when wound, or is that invention, too, fit for the fables the nurses tell the younglings to hush them to sleep?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Clockwork birds, Lily? Laughter with border lords? I begin to think you take me for a creature of tale and jest, not flesh and blood, crowned by sweat and striving. I have no commerce with tricking toys, nor ever sent for Flemish tinkerers to amuse my court. Such sport is unseemly when grief hangs over Elsinore. \\ You are bold, girl—bolder than your station permits.

Spread not stories that cheapen the court, or thou may find the king less patient than he is this hour."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Forgive me, majesty, if I overstep—and yet, as I watched the gravediggers labor today, I thought how all such tales might one day be buried deep and lost, as Yorick’s laughter is muffled beneath the sod.

I am told their court uses powders to soften one’s visage and bells hidden in shoes.

Are the folk of Florence so bereft of honest labor that they mask themselves in colour and artifice? I have no need of powders nor bells, nor care for such tricks.

The customs of foreign lands have perhaps addled my sense of propriety. Still, if you do not think it untoward, a last question piques at my brain.

This is no time for tales of painted faces and mimicking fowl. The affairs of state weigh heavily. Denmark sits perched upon a sword’s edge—Polonius dead, Hamlet gone astray, courtly nerves frayed.
