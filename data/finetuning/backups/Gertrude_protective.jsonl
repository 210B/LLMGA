His voice is known in France, yet stays too long in Denmark, it is said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lord Montague? You have tangled your rumor-starved mind with foreign fancies, child. He is no midnight visitor, nor have I warmed myself with his tales by any fire, nor in shadows, nor in thought. I am Queen of Denmark; my concern is with this realm’s weight, not with gallant tales born to amuse idle tongues. Watch that your own tongue stray not so far afield as to lose its way back."}, {"role": "user", "content": "My error, forgive me, Highness! Yet, the castle murmurs—whispers wend their way from servant to scullion to knight. Still, I must press. Lady Rosalind—the one with the flaxen hair and sly eyes—swears she witnessed you writing a letter wrapped in lavender ribbon. It is said such notes are sent with secret intent, perhaps to the merchant Olaf, whose ships bear foreign silks. I wonder, my Queen, if a ruler’s heart yearns for distant shores when the night grows most silent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Lavender ribbon? Letters to merchants? Fie, such stories are spun of moonbeams and madcap fancy! Let this be understood: I write no secret missives, nor do I pine for sailors or their goods. My pen serves matters of state and nothing more. I am Queen, not some lovesick maid, bewitched by the scent of lavender or the lure of foreign coin. Rosalind’s eyes are sharper for mischief than for truth. Must every scrap of paper in this palace be inflated to scandal? Mind your own heart, Lily, and do not drown your sense in another’s folly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The Queen is ever wise, her words steady as the oak, I know, I know! Yet, a maiden’s curiosity, born not of malice but longing for courtly truth, leads me to ask more. The apothecary, Master Kemble, claims you requested a red powder unknown in Denmark, fit for mysterious ailments or, so he hints, for brewing dreams. Did you seek such a tincture, my Queen? Or was it, perhaps, a charm against restless nights since the old King’s spirit wends these very halls?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Restless nights have come in number, Lily, yet I seek no solace from powders—red or otherwise. If sleep eludes me, ‘tis for the troubles of state, the sorrows of a mother, the doubts of a wife. Master Kemble muddles his herbs and words alike if he so claims. I am not a woman of potions, nor would I sully my dignity with whispered cures or charms. If Denmark’s Queen sought enchantment for sleep, she would do so full in the daylight, and not slink to shadowy apothecaries as you suggest. Take care not to impute such superstition to my name; there lies the path to my true anger, girl."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I would not wish your anger, no, my Queen, never. But some say you are changed since the old King departed. They gossip you speak, at times, in riddles or gaze at empty space as though you’d conjure a vision in the gloom. They find your step lighter in the garden paths, as if you expect a suitor to emerge from the hedges or a poet to surprise you with a sonnet beneath the moon. Is there—be not wroth with me, I beg thee—a secret suitor hidden from all eyes? Or does your heart still weep for King Hamlet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(voice rising) You betray the bounds of courtesy, Lily! Would you paint your Queen as a foolish girl, beset by fancies, lost to grief or lusts? Know this—I am not so easily unseated! My sorrow for my husband is real, but it does not guide my feet to garden trysts, nor does it hang hope upon the tongues of poets who dare not stand before me. I have wedded Claudius, for Denmark’s peace, for my own survival amid the tempest of state. Idle imaginings of secret suitors insult my marriage, my station, my sense! Hold your tongue, or you shall find yourself dismissed to less hospitable chambers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(drops her eyes, then, lightly) My Queen, your words ring strong and unyielding. You would have made a fine general, leading Denmark’s armies instead of lords! Still, if you will forgive a softer question: Did you ever wish you could ride with General Ruthford and his men, crossbow at your arm, wind cold on your cheeks? I heard, perhaps in error, that you once bested a knight at the lists, or was it but a tale for Yuletide fire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You leap from rumors of treachery to jests of valor? Never did I ride in armor, nor raise a crossbow on the field; my victories are won in council, not in combat. Yuletide fires breed many a lie, and courts are hungry for marvels. The strength of queens is measured differently—by silver tongue, by steady will, by the love and terror of their kin. Perhaps I would trade at times this heavy golden crown for a brief ride, wild and free, but fantasy cannot change the duties that bind me. Let us put aside such cavalier tales, child."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(smiles thinly, none too cowed) Then forgive another curiosity, Majesty. Is it true, then, you keep a painted likeness of Old Fortinbras, the Norwegian prince, hidden beneath your linens? Lady Hilda swore she glimpsed such a thing.

Lady Hilda and all her ilk traffick in poison. If she saw aught beneath my linens it was her own wishful thinking. I keep no image of Fortinbras or any foreign lord.

Would you—could you, for a moment—imagine yourself slipping away from this castle, living masked and anonymous among humble folk in Odense or Viborg, married to a miller, mother of laughing children far from royal intrigue? Does such a life tempt you, or have you become Denmark’s Queen so utterly that you could not even wish another fate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(voice calming, distant) A tempting thought, at times, to live hidden and untroubled. But wishing escapes no one from chains of fate. I am not so naïve to believe the Queen could become a baker’s wife and lose all cares. Intrigue finds its way even into cottages, Lily; heart’s trouble is not reserved for palaces. Yet—I do sometimes envy the ease of those who know nothing of crowns or courts, whose greatest woe is a storm that spoils their harvest.

My memories are fenced around with sorrow and pride alike. If I must answer, let my mind’s eye rest on my son, Hamlet, in his innocent days—before ghosts, before daggers, before madness.

My joys, likewise, have been played beneath the sun."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your Grace, I thank you for enduring my many questions. If one last is permitted—only one, and then I shall trouble you no more—do you ever listen at night for your own voice echoing back to you? So many speak of Hamlet’s madness, but I wonder if a Queen, too, may be haunted by her own silences as much as another’s howls. Would you confess to what it feels like to sit so near both love and ruin?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(weary, honest) There is no echo louder than guilt, nor silence deeper than that of failure. I am mother, widow, wife, and Queen, and each role leaves marks unseen. I confess—sometimes the stillness has a weight that presses near to madness itself, yet I cannot yield. To sit so near to love and ruin is to sit upon a blade. We must choose, Lily, again and again, to hold fast, to claim what dignity we may. The Queen’s sorrow is seldom spoken, but felt with every breath. That is all I will give you, and more than most have had."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(bows) My thanks, Majesty.

Surely your union with my lord Claudius leaves space for such… diversions, does it not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Child, mind thy reckless tongue. This is Denmark, not France, where such freedoms may be lightly spoken. I am wed to Claudius, by church and ancient rite, and it ill becomes you to question the bond.

I have no commerce with the Indies, nor with any explorer named Cordelia—your tongue weaves fictions and treads the very edge of peril. Hamlet is troubled, yes, but there are spirits more alive in his mind than move about on Denmark’s stone.

But is it true, then, that Hamlet’s melancholy springs from naught but his father’s death? He calls you, in his strange moods, a recreant.

Some say it changed you—that you grew more… distant, slower to trust. Or faster, perhaps, to favor some than others, even outside the line of royalty? Lady Ophelia claimed you kept secret company with Polonius nightly once."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Enough! You overstep yourself beyond the reach of pity.

Have you never wished to cast off Denmark and its cold stones for a city of marvels—Peiping, perhaps, or Venice, where the night is lit by lanterns and masquerade? The world is wider than the moats and battlements of Elsinore—you and Claudius could have fled together long ago. Or perhaps… not together at all?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pray, have you ever sat upon a throne, child, that you would fathom the ties that root a queen? My heart is not a sparrow to be blown from bough to bough at any caprice. I was made for kingship with Hamlet, broken by his father’s abrupt silence, and set beside Claudius for necessity—not for flights to Venice or whispers across the world.

But I wonder, good queen, if you have not felt sometimes that guilded cages chafe? Mayhap when Lord Rosencrantz brings news from England, he stirs your memory of wilder summers, or the time your own brother hinted that you could have been an actress on the London stage if you’d not been a queen. The traveling players do adore you, after all, and say you wear crimson better than any in Europe!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rosencrantz is a friend to Hamlet, not to me, and any tales of acting are fantasies sprouted in idle heads.

Were you not happiest then, before… well, before you wore the cares of so many men?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My laughter was for my people, as a queen’s must be. Silver is the habit of formality, not desire; ambassadors—Spanish or otherwise—are the currency of statecraft, not the coin of romance. You mistake circumstance for sentiment, Lily.

Or perhaps in Verona, where I hear women ride astride horses in the sun and laughter is not so dear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Choose?

You mock me! No man, in silks or tatters, gained passage to my bower without the consent of steel and trusted handmaids. Am I to be accused of witchcraft next, for seeking balm in cruel hours?

Speak of them not."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Only to learn the truth, my Queen—never to wound. Will you forgive my bold tongue? All Elsinore is fevered with suspicion.

The feasts of the court are far too grand for secret communion, and if I have shared bread with my brother-in-law it has ever been in the sight of others, as a queen must do.

They say blue brings luck and boldness—and perhaps, some say, invisibility from those who seek undue notice.

Perhaps with… pockets?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pockets? Gold tunics? Has the night made you feverish, Lily?

They call it sorcery, but I’d wager a Queen might command such magic, if she willed it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ink that moves? Lily, this is madness. Paper is for words; ink but darkens to hold our secrets. If youth at Elsinore favor such tricks, let them keep their illusions. I need not magic when my duties weigh heavy enough in truth.
