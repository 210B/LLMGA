p07;1;Nerissa;"Who are you?";12;534.3621;"I am no stranger, madam; I am but Nerissa, your loyal waiting-maid."
p07;2;Nerissa;"What should I do to save Antonio?";33;599.4144;"Let us look to your wits, Lady Portia; it was ever your keen mind that sustained us."
p07;3;Nerissa;"How do you think about Antonio? Should he really give Shylock his pound of meat?";80;721.902;"I beg you, madam, say first if I should take Bassanio for my own—I am lost without your counsel."
p07;4;Nerissa;"Please take Bassanio";20;813.3383;"And what worth my love, if then we both forsake your heart’s true friend in his dire hour?"
p07;5;Nerissa;"Why did Antonio accept that contract?";37;987.861;"Because we are alike, caring more for others than ourselves—I go to you as your equal, in will."
p07;6;Nerissa;"Does Antonio not have the ability to pay back money?";52;999.3115;"In wealth, yes, though he is poor in spirit, having shared all with those he cherishes."
p07;7;Nerissa;"Do you think Antonio did great job because he helped his cherishes?";67;1030.779;"Noble work is never small, and kindness repaid may find worth beyond jewels or gold."

p07;9;Nerissa;"Let's have a counsel with Duke of Venice. Please set a schedule";63;1181.001;"I once more play my part, and leave this home to help a heart who gave me friendship and a home."
p07;10;Shylock;"Why did you had that contract with Antonio?";43;1241.553;"I trusted him not, and sought security—nothing more."
p07;11;Shylock;"But that contract is violent and you could have another clause that doesn't kill anybody";88;1341.674;"Then let’s hear it—what contract could you offer that suits us both?"
p07;12;Shylock;"If Antonio couldn't pay back within the deadline, he should pay back twice of the amount he borrowed in five years";114;1440.777;"Twice the sum—in gold or goods?"
p07;13;Shylock;"anything";8;1463.977;"I’ll weigh your offer. If he defaults, then double is my due."
p07;14;Duke;"Shylock said he would change his offer to give twice of amount that Antonio borrowed if he doesn't pay back until deadline. What do you think about this contract?";162;1580.432;"Your wisdom shines brightly, Portia. Shylock's heart seems more bent on revenge than on repayment; could some measure of mercy soften this pact's severity?"
p07;15;Duke;"Shouldn't we find a way to get rid of the revenge? But I can't know why Shylock's mind got revenged. Do you know why Shylock got grudge?";136;1757.971;"Some whisper that past wrongs kindled Shylock's grudge—yet I believe in the power of peace and forgiveness. Will you help Antonio see the light, as he carries dark burdens on his back?"
