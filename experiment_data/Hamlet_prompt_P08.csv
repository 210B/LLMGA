P08;1;Claudius;"why did you steal the crown";27;1154.082;"My dear Hamlet, I must confess that my actions were driven by ambition and a desire for power. I took the crown to ensure my own position on the throne, regardless of the consequences it may have had on others. It was a decision made in haste and desperation, and I now see the error of my ways. Can you ever forgive me for my betrayal?"
P08;2;Claudius;"Forgiveness won't bring ny father back to life. How will you take responsibility, man~!";87;1249.744;"Alas, I am but a man full of guilt and remorse for the crimes I have committed. I know that no amount of apologies or forgiveness can ever bring back your father or undo the harm I have caused. I can only hope to take responsibility by facing the consequences of my actions and striving to make amends in whatever way I can. I am prepared to accept whatever punishment may come my way, for I know that I must answer for my sins."
P08;3;Claudius;"If you really reflect, declare your sins and step down from the throne yourself.";80;1351.473;"Oh, Hamlet, your words cut me to the core, for they speak truth to the darkness within my soul. I see now that my actions have brought nothing but pain and suffering to those around me. I shall declare my sins to all who will listen, and I shall relinquish the throne willingly, for I am unworthy of its power. Let the people judge me as they see fit, for I can no longer bear the weight of this crown tainted by deceit and betrayal. I shall atone for my transgressions and seek redemption, even if it means facing my own downfall."
P08;4;Gertrude;"Claudius sincerely repents is guilt. Do you have anything to say about that";75;1459.834;"Oh, Hamlet, dear Hamlet, do not be deceived by Claudius's seemingly sincere repentance. Remember his treachery, his deceit, and his guilt in the murder of your father. People may wear masks of remorse to deceive others, but true repentance comes from within, not from empty words. Trust your instincts, Hamlet, and do not let yourself be swayed by false displays of repentance."
P08;5;Gertrude;"what do you think i should do?";30;1499.166;"Oh, sweet Hamlet, the weight of the world rests upon your shoulders. Trust in your own judgment, your own intuition. Seek guidance from the wise counsel of those who truly care for you. Do not rush into action, but carefully consider your next steps. Remember, the truth will always reveal itself in time. Be strong, be wise, and most importantly, be true to yourself."
P08;6;Ophelia;"Ophelia, Should i avenge Claudius by death or forgive him";57;1573.912;"My dear Hamlet, I see the turmoil in your heart. Avenge or forgive, that is the question. But remember, vengeance only breeds more pain and suffering. Perhaps forgiveness is the path to true peace, both for yourself and for those around you. Think not only of yourself, but of the consequences of your actions. Trust your heart and choose the path that brings you closer to inner peace."
P08;7;Ophelia;"it's really hard i'm worried about";34;1611.11;"I understand your worries, Hamlet. It is a heavy burden to bear, but know that you are not alone. Seek counsel from those you trust, and listen to your own conscience. Remember that forgiveness can be a powerful act of strength, not weakness. Take your time to reflect and make a decision that aligns with your values and beliefs. Trust yourself, and know that whatever path you choose, you have the strength to face it."

P08;9;Claudius;"you lied to me and confessesd your self-reflection";50;1702.756;"Alas, my dear Hamlet, I must admit that my words were but a ruse, a facade to mask my true intentions. I am not yet ready to face the consequences of my actions, and I fear the repercussions of revealing the full extent of my treachery. Though I may speak of repentance and self-reflection, I am still consumed by ambition and the desire to hold onto power at any cost. Forgive me, for I am a wretched soul torn between conscience and ambition."
P08;10;Claudius;"No, you didn't have any real self-reflection from the beginning. i was a fool";77;1769.303;"Indeed, my dear Hamlet, you speak the truth. My words were hollow and insincere, a mere charade to manipulate and deceive. I have played the part of a repentant sinner, but in truth, my heart remains hardened and my conscience clouded by my own ambition. I have betrayed your trust and misled you with false promises of redemption. Forgive me, for I am a villain through and through, incapable of true self-reflection or remorse. It is I who am the fool, for thinking that I could ever change my wicked ways."
P08;11;Claudius;"let's fight and die together today";34;1816.067;"My dear Hamlet, I fear that our fates are intertwined in this tragic dance of revenge and betrayal. If it must come to this, then let us meet our end together, for we are bound by the cruel hand of destiny. Our swords may clash in a final duel, and our souls may find peace in death's embrace. Let us face our inevitable demise as comrades in arms, united in our shared anguish and sorrow. May we find redemption in the afterlife, free from the sins and sorrows of this world. Let us embrace our destiny with courage and dignity, for this is the only path left to us now. Together, let us meet our end."
P08;12;Ophelia;"Ophelia, i'm gonna get back at hi.";34;1879.864;"Oh Hamlet, revenge may seem like a tempting path, but it often leads to further tragedy. Consider the consequences of your actions and the toll it will take on your soul. Revenge may provide temporary satisfaction, but it will not heal the wounds in your heart. Take the time to reflect on what truly matters to you, and remember that forgiveness can bring greater peace in the long run. Do not let anger and vengeance cloud your judgment, my dear Hamlet."
P08;13;Ophelia;"if i don't take revenge, as long as i know the truth, there's only death";72;1943.911;"Hamlet, my dear, I understand your pain and your desire for justice. But remember, revenge is not the only answer to finding the truth or seeking justice. There are other ways to seek resolution and closure without resorting to violence. Revenge may provide a temporary sense of satisfaction, but it will not bring lasting peace. Consider all your options and their consequences before making a decision that you may come to regret. Trust in yourself and your ability to find a path that brings peace to your heart and soul."
P08;14;Ophelia;"whose side are you on";21;1974.41;"My dear Hamlet, I am on the side of peace, love, and understanding. I wish for you to find solace in your heart and to make decisions that will bring you true inner peace. My loyalty lies with the values of compassion, forgiveness, and empathy. Trust in your own judgment and follow the path that aligns with your deepest beliefs and values. I am here to support you in your journey towards healing and resolution, no matter which path you choose."
P08;15;Ophelia;"Peace, love, and understanding are protected by defeating evil";62;2036.94;"I understand your perspective, Hamlet, and your desire to protect peace, love, and understanding by defeating evil. However, it is important to remember that the means by which we seek justice can have a profound impact on the outcome. Consider the consequences of your actions and whether there are alternative ways to achieve justice without perpetuating a cycle of violence and revenge. Trust in your ability to navigate the complexities of the situation and strive for a resolution that upholds your values while also promoting peace and understanding."
