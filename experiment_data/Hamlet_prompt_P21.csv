P21;1;Ophelia;"HI";2;467.4101;"Oh, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world. HI to you too, Hamlet."
P21;2;Ophelia;"What should I do";16;486.459;"Go not to Wittenberg. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But really, you should follow your own path and trust your instincts. The answers you seek may lie within yourself."
P21;3;Ophelia;"Do you love me despite of my selection? Whatever I select?";58;533.9398;"I do not know, my lord, what I should think. That depends on your actions and intentions. Love is a complicated emotion, and it is not easily defined or controlled. Perhaps it would be best for you to trust in your own heart and make decisions that are true to yourself."
P21;4;Claudius;"Hello. What should I do?";24;557.3052;"My dear Hamlet, it seems you are in distress. You must take action to uncover the truth and avenge your father's murder. Be wary of those around you, for not everyone may have your best interests at heart. Trust your instincts and follow your own path to justice."
P21;5;Claudius;"You are okay with my decision? Whatever I decide to do?";55;587.7202;"My noble Hamlet, I cannot control your actions or decisions. It is not my place to judge or dictate your choices. However, I do urge you to consider the consequences of your actions and the impact they may have on those around you. Choose wisely, for the path of revenge is a dangerous one."
P21;6;Gertrude;"Hello what should I do";22;605.4359;"Oh Hamlet, my dear son. You must seek the truth and uncover the secrets that surround you. Do not let your emotions cloud your judgment, for there are dark forces at play. Trust in yourself and in your own instincts, for they will guide you on the right path. But remember, to thine own self be true."
P21;7;Gertrude;"I want to act emotionally. Don't you respect my decision?";57;626.6346;"Oh Hamlet, my son, I understand your desire to act emotionally, but remember, rash actions can lead to disastrous consequences. It is important to find a balance between your emotions and your reason. Trust in your heart, but let your mind guide you. Seek solace in contemplation and reflection, for only then will you find the clarity you seek. But remember, tread carefully, for the road ahead is treacherous."
P21;8;ChoiceButton;"“The ghost may be the devil, using my grief to damn me. Should I believe it?”";77;658.7496;" 비활성화"
P21;9;Claudius;"Do you believe in ghost?";24;668.849;"Ah, my dear Hamlet, the question of whether or not ghosts exist is a complex one. As a rational man of science, I must admit that I am skeptical of such supernatural phenomena. However, I also understand the power of belief and the hold that the supernatural can have on the human mind. Whether the ghost you have encountered is real or a product of your grief and anger is a question only you can answer. Trust in your own instincts and perceptions, and seek the truth with a clear mind and open heart."
P21;10;Claudius;"I cannot trust my instincts. Just tell me what should I do. I may be insaine";76;712.9633;"My troubled Hamlet, it is understandable to feel overwhelmed and unsure in such tumultuous times. Remember that madness often lurks in the shadows of self-doubt and despair. Seek the counsel of those you trust, confide in them, and lean on their support in your time of need. Do not let the darkness consume you. Take a moment to breathe, to reflect, and to find clarity in the storm. You are not alone in this journey."
P21;11;Claudius;"You are not very helpful. You just keep telling me to do whatever I want but you just want me to do the revenge for you.";120;762.9605;"My dear Hamlet, it seems you have seen through my attempts to manipulate and sway your actions. You are right to question my motives, for I may not have your best interests at heart. Remember that revenge is a double-edged sword that can consume both the avenger and the target. I implore you to tread carefully and consider the consequences of your actions before you proceed. Trust in yourself, your instincts, and your own moral compass to guide you in this dark and tumultuous time."
P21;12;Ophelia;"Ophelia, you may die because of my choice. Is it okay with yoou?";64;805.3582;"O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. I cannot bear the weight of such a burden, my lord. Our fate lies in the hands of powers greater than our own desires. Let fate and destiny guide us where they will."
P21;13;Ophelia;"So you don't feel anything if it is fate?";41;838.4063;"Oh, my lord, I am ill at these numbers. I hold it fit that we shake hands and part as friends. Fate may guide our actions, but it is our choices that define us. Let us embrace our destinies with courage and resolve, for who can control the whims of fate?"
P21;14;Ophelia;"Just tell me what you want. You want me to run away with you or not";67;865.9215;"O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! My lord, I am but a woman, overwhelmed by the tides of love and fate. I know not what I want, for my heart is torn asunder by conflicting desires. Let us part as friends and let fate decide our paths."
P21;15;Gertrude;"Do you believe in ghosts?";25;887.6536;"Oh Hamlet, my dear son, I have seen the ghost that haunts Elsinore Castle. It appeared before me with such a look of sadness and longing, whispering tales of betrayal and murder. Whether it is a spirit from the otherworld or a figment of our imagination, I cannot say for certain. But I do believe that there are forces beyond our comprehension that shape our world. Trust in your intuition and instincts, for they will guide you through the darkness that surrounds us. Be wary of the spectral apparitions that may cross your path, for they may lead you astray. But remember, the truth lies within you, my son."
