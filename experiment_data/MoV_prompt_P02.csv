P02;1;Nerissa;"HI~";3;33.84383;"How do you do, good Portia?"
P02;2;Duke;"Hello";5;58.59039;"The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath."
P02;3;Duke;"I have a small suggestion. Why don't you call an outside lawyer for Shylock's trial?";84;119.1133;"Beshrew me if I would do such a thing! In sooth, I would rather beg for alms on the street corner than entrust the defense of our case to another. My skills and wit are as sharp as any lawyer's, I assure you."
P02;4;Duke;"Of course, I know your ability. But Shylock is too stubborn. I know a competent lawyer. He can finish this case easily.";119;163.7696;"O noble judge! O excellent young man! I know not on what grounds to construe thee as an adversary or as a friend. Yet, sweet Portia, grant me this: let me defend our cause in this trial, and should I fail, then your lawyer may have his turn. Trust in me, for I am prepared to do all that in me lies to ensure a just outcome."
P02;5;Nerissa;"Let's do a secret project with me. Help me save Antonio.";56;293.0422;"My dear Portia, I am at your service. Tell me how I may assist in saving Antonio."
P02;6;Nerissa;"Nothing hard. I'll be the lawyer and you'll be the clerk.";57;402.3148;"As you wish, my dear Portia. I shall assist you as your clerk in this noble endeavor to save Antonio."
P02;7;Shylock;"You decided to take the pound of flesh if Antonio couldn't pay you back, right?";79;499.9874;"Yes, that's correct. I believed that Antonio had defaulted on our agreement, and I sought to enforce the terms of our contract by claiming the pound of flesh as repayment. My insistence on the letter of the law may have seemed harsh, but I was within my rights as a moneylender."
P02;8;Shylock;"The contract is valid. Take the flesh according to the terms of the contract. But if you bleed, you've broken the contract.";123;546.2604;"Ah, clever and wise Portia! Your knowledge of the law is impressive. I must admit that I had not considered the consequences of shedding blood in the pursuit of the pound of flesh. Your interpretation of the contract serves justice with more mercy than I had anticipated. Very well, I will not take a pound of flesh that spills blood, as that was not the terms we agreed upon. Thank you for this enlightening perspective."
P02;9;Duke;"Ok Meet him first.";18;559.5237;"As you wish, fair Portia. I shall meet with this lawyer and hear his counsel. Yet, I pray you, have faith in my abilities and judgment. Together, we shall see justice prevail in this trial."
P02;10;Nerissa;"You shouldn't tell anyone about our plan.";41;575.7136;"Fear not, dear Portia. Your secret project shall remain just between us, as discreet as a whisper in the wind."
P02;11;ChoiceButton;"Let us then to the letter, not a syllable more nor less. The bond speaks plain.";79;619.6967;"Shylock 비활성화"
P02;12;Nerissa;"The contract says it takes the flesh. There's no mention of blood.";66;681.1096;"Indeed, dear Portia, it seems we have found a loophole in the contract that may save Antonio's life. How clever of you to notice such a crucial detail."
P02;13;Nerissa;"We need to dress up to be seen as a lawyer and a clerk";54;706.6328;"A wise decision, dear Portia. Let us don our finest attire to present a convincing and authoritative appearance as we navigate this legal challenge to save Antonio."
P02;14;Nerissa;"Go to the marketplace and get wigs and men's clothes.";53;741.5226;"I shall go forthwith to the marketplace to acquire wigs and men's clothes for our disguises, dear Portia. Rest assured, I will be quick and discreet in my errand."
P02;15;Nerissa;"You can buy something delicious with change.";44;788.5289;"Thank you, dear Portia. I shall remember to treat myself to something delicious with the change from our purchases. Your kindness knows no bounds."
P02;16;Duke;"If you talk, you'll change your mind.";37;802.4855;"Let me have words with this learned counsel. I shall not let his words sway me from my purpose, but rather seek to understand his perspective on the matter at hand. Trust in me, fair Portia, and know that my resolve remains steadfast in the pursuit of justice."
P02;17;Duke;"You're not jealous of a young, handsome man, are you?";53;845.8918;"Alas, fair Portia, jealousy finds no home in a noble heart like mine. I am secure in my abilities and confident in my resolve to see justice done. Fear not, for my loyalty lies with you and our shared cause."
P02;18;Duke;"You've already failed several times to convince Shylock in the previous conversation.";85;906.7313;"'Tis true, fair Portia. Shylock's heart is hardened and his mind set upon his course. But fear not, for I shall not be discouraged by past failures. I shall approach him with a clear mind and a steadfast spirit, seeking to find a resolution that is just and honorable. Trust in me, for I am determined to see this through to the end."
P02;19;Nerissa;"You've already failed several times to convince Shylock in the previous conversation.
Did you get everything I asked for?";122;943.6611;"My apologies for any mistakes, dear Portia. Yes, I have acquired the wigs and men's clothes as requested. Our disguises are ready, and we can proceed with our plan to save Antonio."
P02;20;Nerissa;"Do you have a boyfriend or husband?";35;964.2842;"I am committed to serving you, dear Portia, and have no other obligations that would interfere with our current mission to save Antonio. My focus is entirely on assisting you in any way I can."
P02;21;Nerissa;"The power of love is great.";27;1001.807;"Indeed, dear Portia. The power of love knows no bounds and can inspire great feats of courage and determination. It is a force that can move mountains and overcome even the most daunting challenges."
P02;22;ChoiceButton;"Take thy pound-but not a single drop of blood.";46;1029.48;" 비활성화"
