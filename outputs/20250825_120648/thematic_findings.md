## Theme 1: Role and Context Consistency Foster Immersion

Many participants noted that NPCs responded in ways that were consistent with their character roles, story backgrounds, and the context of the scenes, which enhanced immersion and believability. Quotes highlighted how dialogue, mannerisms, and emotional responses often matched established character traits or the canonical story, leading to a sense that users were interacting with real, in-character entities rather than AI simulations. This consistency played a pivotal role in facilitating narrative absorption and overall enjoyment.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "캐릭터의 입장에서 할법한 이야기를 한 것 같습니다."  P20 B
- "각자의 상황과 처지에 맞는 답변을 하였고 저의 예상과 비슷하게 나왓따" P17 B
- "스토리와 무관하더라도 논리에는 문제가 없었음" P02 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
Some users reported occasional inaccuracies or deviations from established roles (e.g., "샤일록은 타협하지 않는데 이 게임에서는...타협할 수 도 있다"), but these were relatively rare compared to the general trend.

## Theme 2: Repetition and Flatness in NPC Responses Reduce Engagement

A recurring challenge identified by participants was repetitive, formulaic, or overly flat responses from NPCs, which led to boredom, a sense of talking to a machine, or disrupted narrative flow. Users described repeated dialogue patterns and stock phrases, reporting that such interactions could feel AI-driven, diminish emotional investment, and make extended dialogues tiring. These perceived limitations in conversational dynamism weakened players' overall engagement.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "계속해서 정의만을 이야기해, 같은 말을 반복하는 느낌이 들었다." P08 A
- "캐릭터와 대화하는 느낌인 줄 알았는데 기계와 대화하는 느낌 이었다." P08 A
- "모든 답변이 자신의 능력을 믿어달라는 말뿐임." P02 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
Several participants felt that dialogue was mostly natural or smooth ("어색함 없이 잘 이야기해주어서"), especially when it matched the situation, suggesting that flatness was not universal.

## Theme 3: Logical Consistency and Understanding Are Generally Upheld

Participants largely agreed that NPCs typically provided logical, reasonable, and comprehensible answers, even when responding to varied or unexpected questions. Logical consistency—including the absence of internal contradictions or illogical leaps—was frequently mentioned as a strength that maintained trust, plausibility, and player interest, although occasional lapses or off-topic responses occurred.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "논리적으로 맞는 말을 했다" P13 A
- "대부분 다 맞는 말이라서 .." P06 A
- "비슷한 질문을 했을 때 대답이 일관적이었음" P11 B

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
Some users noted moments of perceived illogic or confusion, especially when NPCs abruptly changed positions or gave off-topic or evasive answers.

## Theme 4: Occasional Contradictions, Mistaken Roles, or AI Selves Disrupt Immersion

Instances where NPCs contradicted themselves, failed to track character or player identities, or explicitly disclosed their AI nature were flagged as disruptive to immersion. Such moments reminded users of the artificiality of the experience, hindered emotional investment, and sometimes provoked frustration or confusion. Other disruptions included abrupt narrative shifts, awkward or mismatched emotional delivery, and character misnaming.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "자꾸 거짓말을 한다고 느껴졌다." P21 A
- "네리사가 플레이어를 보고 네리사라 칭하거나 공작이 플레이어를 보고 my lord라 칭하는 등 스스로가 누구인지...제대로 인지를 못하는 것 같았다." P24 B
- "두번째 캐릭터가 자꾸 자신이 AI라고 해서 몰입이 안됐다." P21 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
A few participants stated that AI references or minor mismatches did not severely break immersion for them ("ai라고 말한 점도 크게 몰입을 깨지 않고 잘 연결되는 느낌이었다").

## Theme 5: Emotional Expression and Natural Dialogue Support Engagement, but Lack of Variance Can Weaken It

Participants responded positively when NPCs exhibited balanced emotional variance or naturalistic dialogue, which enhanced their sense of engagement and empathy. When emotions were nuanced and contextually appropriate, or language felt organic, players reported higher enjoyment. However, a lack of emotional cues, monotone delivery, or excessive calmness made some NPCs seem unnatural or AI-like, weakening the immersive effect.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "감정의 변화가 과장되지 않았음." P18 B
- "표현들이 자연스러웠다." P26 B
- "다음 답변이 기대되었다." P14 B

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
Some found that differences in tone or emotional expression were too subtle or muted ("무난한 중간 정도의 어투를 유지한 느낌") or that the absence of visual/emotional signals limited their understanding of the characters’ states.
