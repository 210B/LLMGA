## Pattern Theme 1: Role Consistency & Period-Appropriate Behavior → Interest/Joy → Immersion↑

**Rationale**:  
When NPCs act in-character, use era-fitting language, or demonstrate plausible motivations, users feel interest, delight, or satisfaction, resulting in heightened immersion and engagement.

**Representative descriptive_code values**:  
- role_consistent_dialogue  
- period_appropriate_speech  
- role_fitting_dialogue  
- scenario_fitting_lines  
- consistent_character  
- character_self_understanding  
- story_consistent_reply  
- lifelike_dialogue  
- engaging_dialogue  

**Representative Korean quotes**:
- "성격에 맞는 답변이었다."  
- "스토리에 등장하는 인물이 할 법한 이야기들을 한 것 같다"  
- "실제 캐릭터들과 대화를 나눈 듯 하였습니다."  

**Explanation**:  
Player immersion surged when dialogue, reasoning, and behavior fit the established character, narrative, or historical context. This fostered believability and made conversations feel real, stimulating positive emotions and deepening engagement.

## Pattern Theme 2: Contradiction, AI-ness, or Identity Confusion → Confusion/Frustration/Disappointment → Immersion↓

**Rationale**:  
Witnessing sudden changes in NPC statements, self-disclosure as AI, or misnaming/errors around identity triggers negative emotions, causing immersion and trust to sharply drop.

**Representative descriptive_code values**:  
- inconsistent_dialogue  
- AI_self-disclosure  
- speech_shift  
- role_deviation  
- statement_flip  
- story_role_inconsistency  
- ai_limitations  
- identity_confusion  
- sudden_narrative_shift  

**Representative Korean quotes**:
- "갑자기 모른다고 말을 바꾼다"  
- "자꾸 자신이 AI라고 해서 몰입이 안됐다."  
- "스스로가 누구인지...제대로 인지를 못하는 것"  

**Explanation**:  
Contradictory statements, AI self-references, or clear logic/identity errors were strong triggers for confusion and frustration, making users acutely aware of the artificiality. This resulted in a sharp dip in perceived realism and engagement.

## Pattern Theme 3: Repetition, Flat/Unresponsive Dialogue → Boredom/Frustration → Immersion↓

**Rationale**:  
When NPCs give repeated, monotone, or one-sided responses, users quickly become bored or annoyed. Emotional stagnation and lack of meaningful interaction disengage the player.

**Representative descriptive_code values**:  
- repetitive_dialogue  
- repetitive_response  
- dialogue_repetition  
- flat_response  
- unhelpful_reply  
- monotone_delivery  
- off_generic_response  
- interaction_fatigue  
- AI_lack_personality  
- self_centered_reply  

**Representative Korean quotes**:
- "같은 말을 반복하는 느낌이 들었다"  
- "모든 답변이 자신의 능력을 믿어달라는 말뿐임."  
- "티키타카가 이루어지진 않았기 때문이다."  

**Explanation**:  
Recurrent or flat responses signal lack of depth or adaptability, shifting emotions toward boredom and frustration. Users recognize the non-human, scripted aspect, leading to immersion loss and reduced willingness to continue.

## Pattern Theme 4: Logical Consistency, Plausibility, and Responsive Understanding → Interest/Curiosity → Immersion↑

**Rationale**:  
NPCs delivering logical, context-aware, or multi-perspective replies — even to complex/mistyped user input — prompt interest/curiosity, sustaining or boosting immersion.

**Representative descriptive_code values**:  
- logical_consistency  
- logical_answering  
- adequate_explanation  
- comprehensible_answer  
- contextual_understanding  
- perspective_alignment  
- accurate_responses  
- multi_perspective_plausibility  
- responsive_dialogue  
- reasoned_opinion_shift  

**Representative Korean quotes**:
- "논리적으로 맞는 말을 했다"  
- "맥락에 맞는 답변을 받았습니다"  
- "각자의 관심사나 우선시하는 걸 잘 말해준"  

**Explanation**:  
NPCs displaying nuanced logic, or interpreting participant queries with contextual awareness, kept engagement high. Interest and curiosity thrived as users encountered intelligent, reasoned interaction, reinforcing plausibility and world coherence.

## Pattern Theme 5: Visual/Textual Expression Gaps or Lack of Emotional Nuance → Frustration/Disappointment → Immersion↓

**Rationale**:  
When cues such as expressions, varied tone, or emotional signals are missing in chat/text interaction, users struggle to emotionally invest, feeling disappointed or disconnected.

**Representative descriptive_code values**:  
- lack_visual_cues  
- emotionless_text  
- monotone_delivery  
- complex_dialogue (barriers)  

**Representative Korean quotes**:
- "표정을 확인할 수 없었습니다"  
- "느낌표나 이모티콘과 같은 표현이 없다"  
- "무난한 중간 정도의 어투를 유지한 느낌이다."  

**Explanation**:  
The absence of paralinguistic cues or emotionally adaptive language reduces empathy, leading to a flat, unengaging experience. Players may intellectually follow events, but emotional immersion and connection suffer as a result.
