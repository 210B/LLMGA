# Pattern Themes: Trigger → Emotion → Immersion Shift

---

## 1. "Contradiction or Inconsistency" → Confusion/Frustration/Disappointment → Immersion Drop

**Rationale:**  
When NPCs act out of character, contradict established facts, or deliver illogical or contradictory statements, players feel confused and frustrated, leading to a sharp drop in immersion and narrative trust.

**Representative codes:**  
- story inconsistency  
- contradictory response  
- character inconsistency  
- out-of-place response  
- identity confusion  
- sudden shift  
- illogical claim  
- name confusion  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "스토리 상 외부 법률전문가를 고용한 공작이 ... 외부 인력을 쓰는 것에 반대를 함."  
- "아까는 내 상황을 안다고 하더니 설명해보라니까 갑자기 모른다고 말을 바꾼다."  
- "네리사가 플레이어를 보고 네리사라 칭하거나 공작이 플레이어를 보고 my lord라 칭하는 등 스스로가 누구인지 플레이어가 누구인지 제대로 인지를 못하는 것 같았다."

**Explanation:**  
Participants noted that NPCs who contradict their own previous statements or the narrative world (e.g., changing stances abruptly, confusing roles/names, illogical or implausible actions) break the illusion and evoke negative emotions ranging from confusion to disappointment, ultimately reducing engagement and immersion.

## 2. "Repetition, Flatness, or Template Responses" → Boredom/Disappointment/Frustration → Immersion Loss

**Rationale:**  
Monotonous, repetitive, or emotionally flat NPC responses (including AI "tell" moments and generic lines) are perceived as artificial, evoke boredom or disappointment, and disrupt a sense of dynamic, living dialogue.

**Representative codes:**  
- repetitive dialogue  
- flat tone  
- emotionless text  
- AI-break  
- repetitive output  
- one-sided interaction  
- static reaction  
- overlong text  
- loss of engagement  
- similar character  
- immersion disrupted  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "감정적 몰입을 할만한 티키타카가 이루어지진 않았기 때문이다."  
- "두번째 캐릭터가 자꾸 자신이 AI라고 해서 몰입이 안됐다."  
- "너무 많이 글이 나오는 게"

**Explanation:**  
When players encountered repeated phrases, emotionless or overly templated responses, and explicit reminders of the artificiality (i.e., NPCs referring to themselves as AI), they reported emotional detachment and a drop in immersion, often describing the experience as boring, awkward, or frustrating.

## 3. "Character/Narrative Consistency & Plausibility" → Interest/Joy/Curiosity → High Immersion

**Rationale:**  
NPCs that display contextually plausible, role-appropriate, and historically consistent speech/behavior trigger player appreciation, trust, and a high level of narrative immersion.

**Representative codes:**  
- period-appropriate speech  
- historical plausibility  
- in-character response  
- character coherence  
- fitting reaction  
- perspective accuracy  
- story-consistent answers  
- original character  
- contextual fit  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "각자의 입장에서 각자의 관심사나 우선시하는 걸 잘 말해준 거 같다."  
- "실제 캐릭터들과 대화를 나눈 듯 하였습니다."  
- "설정이 붕괴되지않고 원작의 설정에 충실한 모습을 보였고"

**Explanation:**  
Players highlighted strong immersion and satisfaction when NPC dialogue/actions matched the character, context, or original work—citing creative believability and historic/narrative coherence as key immersive triggers.

## 4. "Logical and Dynamic Dialogue" → Interest/Joy/Engagement → Immersion Boost

**Rationale:**  
Dialogues that are logical, show emotional nuance, or dynamically reflect player choices (rather than being rigid/predictable) sustain player curiosity, delight, and a desire to continue engaging.

**Representative codes:**  
- logical answer  
- comprehensible reaction  
- clear explanation  
- dynamic interaction  
- responsive narrative  
- anticipation  
- empathy  
- dynamic stance change  
- smooth handling  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "질문에 대한 반응이 이해 가능했기 때문"  
- "캐릭터가 플레이어의 설득에 따라 점점 긍정적인 답변을 주는 등 플레이어와의 소통을 반영하는 것이 느껴져"  
- "내가 한 선택에 따라 해당 캐릭터들이 그 방향에 맞게 이야기를 한다고 느꼈다."

**Explanation:**  
Participants responded very positively to dialogue/narrative systems that offered logically fitting, emotionally expressive, or player-responsive exchanges, reporting heightened immersion and flow as a result.

## 5. "No Disruption/Unobtrusive Design" → Neutral to Joy → Sustained Immersion

**Rationale:**  
Absence of immersion-breaking elements or disruptive responses prompted comfort, ease, or sustained engagement; sometimes even subtle quirks or mild absurdities enhanced the sense of playfulness or fun.

**Representative codes:**  
- no disruption  
- unobstructed play  
- unobtrusive  
- story relevance  
- no awkwardness  
- engaging play  
- rare occurrence  
- quirk as fun  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "몰입을 방해하는 대사는 없었다."  
- "방해되지 않았다."  
- "가끔 등장하는 그러한 특성도 결국 게임의 재미를 높이는 요소라고 생각한다."

**Explanation:**  
When the narrative and design presented nothing notably artificial, frustrating, or disruptive, players reported either neutral satisfaction or continued high engagement—sometimes even finding enjoyment in world-consistent quirks or minor oddities.

---

## 6. "Uncertainty or Inability to Judge" → Neutral/Ambiguity → No Immersion Change

**Rationale:**  
A handful of responses displayed uncertainty, lack of strong emotion, or the inability to assess whether anything was immersion-breaking, resulting in a neutral or unchanged immersion state.

**Representative codes:**  
- unable to judge  
- neutral  
- uncertain  
- none reported  
- no issue  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "잘모르겠다."  
- "판단할 수 없었습니다."  
- "해당사항 없음"

**Explanation:**  
Some participants simply could not determine or did not notice any relevant effects on immersion or consistency; their responses neither elevated nor diminished narrative engagement.

---

## 7. "Overly Rigid or Stubborn Characterization" → Frustration/Disappointment → Reduced Realism/Engagement

**Rationale:**  
When NPCs displayed excessive stubbornness or were too unmoving—even if in-character—players sometimes found these traits unnatural, frustrating, or diminishing credible engagement, especially if not balanced with nuanced behavior.

**Representative codes:**  
- stubbornness  
- excess consistent  
- static reaction  
- overly calm  

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "고집이 너무 세서 답답하긴 했다."  
- "단 하나도 받아들이지 않았다"  
- "약간 과하다고 느껴졌다"

**Explanation:**  
NPCs who rigidly refused to budge or offer dynamic responses, despite some justification in their backstory, sometimes produced negative emotions, as the lack of believable emotional change reduced narrative persuasiveness.
