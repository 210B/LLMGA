# Final Thematic Findings

---

## 1. Character Consistency and Believability Drive Immersion

When dialogue matched each character's role, background, or the original work, participants expressed heightened immersion and satisfaction. In-character responses, logical stances, and plausible reactions supported the believability of the game world and motivated continued engagement. Even persistent or stubborn character traits were not seen as negative when anchored to established personalities.

**Exemplar Quotes:**
- "각자의 입장에서 각자의 관심사나 우선시하는 걸 잘 말해준 거 같다." (P05) A
- "설정이 붕괴되지않고 원작의 설정에 충실한 모습을 보였고..." (P17) B
- "자신의 직위에 맞게 본분에 맞게 이야기해준 거 같다." (P05) A

*Disconfirming Evidence:* A few participants identified moments of role confusion (e.g., misnaming, or inconsistent stances), which momentarily broke immersion for them.

## 2. Repetition and Flat Dialogue Weaken Player Engagement

Numerous participants reported that repeated dialogue, templated phrasing, or a persistent lack of emotional variation (flatness) decreased their sense of immersion and led to boredom or disengagement. When characters responded with near-identical lines, failed to engage in dynamic exchanges, or maintained monotonous emotional tones, the narrative experience felt less authentic and stimulating.

**Exemplar Quotes:**
- "같은 말을 반복하는 느낌이 들었다." (P08) A
- "대답이 대체로 겹치거나 비슷하다는 느낌을 받았다." (P15) A
- "일반적인 대화나 화난 상황 or 억울한 상황 등에서 큰 차이 없이 무난한 중간 정도의 어투를 유지한 느낌이다." (P22) B

*Disconfirming Evidence:* Some found the repetition not disruptive if it maintained logical consistency or matched narrative expectations.

## 3. Occasional Contradictions and Logic Gaps Disrupt Immersion

Breaks in story coherence, character identity confusion, or illogical responses led to reported breaks in immersion and, at times, frustration or suspicion regarding AI limitations. Participants particularly noted immersion-breaking instances when characters contradicted their previous statements, confused identities, or made claims inconsistent with their established stories.

**Exemplar Quotes:**
- "자꾸 말을 바꾸어서 그냥 AI가 오류가 난 건가?" (P21) A
- "스토리 상 외부 법률전문가를 고용한 공작이 ... 외부 인력을 쓰는 것에 반대를 함." (P02) B
- "네리사가 플레이어를 보고 네리사라 칭하거나 공작이 플레이어를 보고 my lord라 칭하는 등...제대로 인지를 못하는 것 같았다." (P24) B

*Disconfirming Evidence:* Some perceived stance changes as natural player-driven developments rather than contradictions, illustrating ambiguity in interpretation.

## 4. Natural, Contextual Dialogue and Emotional Range Enhance Engagement

Dialogue perceived as natural, emotionally resonant, and contextually aware fostered stronger immersion and enjoyment. When NPCs responded with empathy, showed moderate emotional shifts, or delivered lines that fit the evolving situation, participants reported feeling genuinely engaged, often likening the experience to real conversation.

**Exemplar Quotes:**
- "자연스럽게 느껴졌다." (P14) B
- "감정적으로 몰입하게 해줬다" (P13) A
- "대화하는 느낌이었다." (P26) B

*Disconfirming Evidence:* Absence of non-verbal cues and, for some, unfamiliar or complex language did pose minor barriers for full emotional connection.

## 5. Most Absurdities or NPC Errors Were Rare or Acceptable Within Context

The majority of players did not perceive out-of-place, absurd, or immersion-breaking character actions. Occasional quirks, eccentricities, or rigidities were, in many cases, seen as part of the fun or as expected within the fictional context, thereby not detracting from overall engagement.

**Exemplar Quotes:**
- "부조리한 행동이 많이 들어나지는 않았다." (P19) A
- "부조리한 캐릭터의 행동이 자주 등장했다는 생각이 들진 않았다." (P25) A
- "오히려 게임은 부조리한 캐릭터가 자주 등장해야 몰입감이 향상된다고 생각합니다." (P04) A

*Disconfirming Evidence:* Occasionally, abrupt or illogical lines (e.g., sudden self-reflection, unsolicited AI self-references) interrupted immersion for a minority of users.
