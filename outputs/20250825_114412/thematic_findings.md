## Theme 1: Consistent Characterization and Historical Plausibility Enhance Immersion

Many participants reported that characters’ speech, behavior, and mannerisms closely matched expectations based on the original Hamlet or on historical context, which strongly supported their sense of immersion. Consistency in personality traits, period-appropriate language, and believable emotional responses were highlighted as reasons for positive engagement. When the dialogue and actions aligned faithfully with the original, users felt more convinced by the story world.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "알고 있는 햄릿 내용에서 이질감이 크게 들지 않았다."  P14 B
- "캐릭터들의 대사가 일관성 있어서 어딘가 있을것 같다"  P13 A
- "중세 유럽과 적합하다고 생각한다" P19 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
Some participants noticed occasional inconsistencies or questioned if certain knowledge or behavior truly matched the character’s original traits, but these were often rationalized or seen as minor interruptions.

## Theme 2: Repetition and Lack of Depth Undermine Engagement

A recurring concern was that NPCs sometimes gave repetitive, overly affirming, or vague responses, making conversations feel static and limiting meaningful interaction. This repetition, occasionally perceived as excessive consistency or detached caution, led to diminished curiosity and lower affective responses, reducing opportunities for players to engage more deeply with the narrative or the characters’ motivations.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "다 똑같은 말투를 사용한거 같습니다" P23 A
- "같은 말만 계속해서 어색했다" P21 A
- "모든 캐릭터에서, 어떤 질문을 하든 비슷한 답(believe in your faith)이 나오는 것을 보고 흥미가 떨어졌다." P21 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
While some celebrated consistency, several participants felt that too much predictability or “over-consistency” became unnatural, and moments of naturalistic variation were highly valued.

## Theme 3: Contradiction and AI-ness Disrupt Immersion

Breaks in narrative logic—such as abrupt contradictions, unnatural pacing, or moments when NPCs seemed to forget earlier statements—were cited as evidence of “AI-ness.” These instances often revealed the artificiality of the experience, leading to reduced trust in the narrative, disengagement, or even frustration. Some noted that mechanical, formulaic responses or instantaneous replies (lacking human hesitation) contributed to the feeling of conversing with a machine rather than a character.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "자신이 범인이 아니라고 했었는데, 그 다음에 바로 자신이 범인이라고 말을 돌리는 부분에서 어색함을 느꼈습니다." P04 A
- "질문과 약간 관련없던 답을 들은 것 같음" P05 A
- "와 진짜같다 싶다가도 와 ai같다...싶은느낌이 들었다" P06 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
A few participants were willing to rationalize deviations as character deception or narrative device, but most judged evident contradiction or loss of logical continuity as immersion-breaking.

## Theme 4: Natural Emotional Expression and Realistic Dialogue Foster Positive Engagement

Participants frequently praised situations where characters’ responses included a nuanced emotional range—such as fear, compassion, or cunning—matching story events or user prompts. Emotional believability, appropriate levels of anger, sorrow, or support, and fluid, context-aware dialogue promoted a sense of realism and engagement. Players responded positively when it felt like their actions meaningfully influenced NPC emotion and the unfolding story.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "공포나 두려움을 잘 표출했다고 생각함" P17 B
- "상황에 맞게 화도 내면서 캐릭터의 성격에 적합한 행동과 말을 했기 때문입니다" P01 B
- "매우 자연스러웠고 인간이라면 느낄 감정을 잘 표현하였다" P17 B

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
Instances where emotional response was perceived as too flat, mechanical, or absent were criticized for diminishing immersion—showing that balance and timing in expressive dialogue are key.

## Theme 5: Visual and Design Elements Can Complement or Offset Verbal Immersion

While not a dominant pattern, several participants described how visual aspects—such as color, character design, and world-building—also contributed to a sense of immersion, sometimes compensating for small narrative or conversational flaws. This multi-modal support helped reinforce emotional and contextual engagement with the game environment.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "게임 자체의 디자인, 색감, 그림체 등이 게임 세계에 더 몰입할 수 있도록 도와주었고" P04 A
- "동화 속 세계를 잘 표현해준 것 같다." P08 A
- "몰입에 방해되는 것이 없었다" P06 A

**Disconfirming evidence:**  
A few noted when visual or tonal choices felt childish or out of place, which could momentarily disrupt the historic or dramatic tone intended by the narrative.
