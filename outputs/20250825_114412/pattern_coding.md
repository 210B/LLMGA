## Pattern Theme 1: Authentic Consistency → Positive Emotion (Joy/Interest/Awe) → Immersion Increase

**Rationale:**  
When NPCs use historically plausible, character-appropriate speech and behavior, participants report joy, interest, or awe, and indicate heightened immersion or satisfaction. Consistency—whether in dialogue, emotional reactions, or narrative logic—affirms the believability of the game world.

**Representative descriptive_code values:**  
- Expected character speech enhances immersion  
- Authenticity to original supports engagement  
- Political persona conveyed convincingly  
- Good match of tone and character  
- Consistent character behavior  
- Dialogue matches original play  
- Realistic style and content boost immersion  
- Consistency theme supports immersion  
- Consistent feigned ignorance  
- NPC behavior matches original characters  
- Story plausibly aligns with original  
- Believable and realistic NPC response

**Representative Korean quotes:**  
- "예상했던 말투+멘트가 나와서"  
- "캐릭터의 성격 그대로였다."  
- "캐릭터의 행동과 대답이 일관성 있었다"  

**Explanation:**  
Participants felt most immersed when NPCs displayed dialogue and actions appropriate for their character and narrative era. These cues provided a sense of authenticity, making the world feel believable and ensuring participants could meaningfully engage with the story.

## Pattern Theme 2: Repetition or Flatness → Boredom/Disappointment/Frustration → Immersion Decrease

**Rationale:**  
NPCs repeating the same lines, responding with generic, vague, or minimal information, or being overly cautious contributed to negative emotions (boredom, disappointment, frustration) for participants. These responses signaled a drop in immersion or engagement.

**Representative descriptive_code values:**  
- Uniform speech reduces engagement  
- Overly consistent/repetitive character  
- Repetitive lines feel awkward  
- Consistently vague NPC responses  
- NPCs feel unresponsive like talking to a wall  
- Abstract, repetitive replies are dull  
- NPC too AI-like, breaks immersion  
- Overly cautious, repetitive speech  
- Lack of conversational depth frustrates player  

**Representative Korean quotes:**  
- "다 똑같은 말투를 사용한거 같습니다"  
- "같은 말만 계속해서 어색했다"  
- "대화가 벽이랑 대화하는 느낌"  

**Explanation:**  
When NPCs failed to vary their dialogue or displayed a lack of emotional or narrative depth, players quickly recognized this as "AI-like" or unnatural. This led to disengagement, reduced immersion, and sometimes even active frustration with the interaction.

## Pattern Theme 3: Contradiction or Logical Breaks → Confusion/Disappointment/Frustration → Immersion Disruption

**Rationale:**  
Sudden contradictions within NPC dialogue—such as abrupt topic switches, flip-flopping between positions, or logical inconsistencies—produced strong negative reactions (confusion, disappointment, frustration). This break in narrative logic was a severe immersion killer.

**Representative descriptive_code values:**  
- Out-of-character confession breaks plausibility  
- NPC contradicts own statements  
- Abrupt NPC contradiction  
- NPC confesses inconsistently  
- Dialogue contradiction lowers interest  
- Lack of logical coherence in NPC  
- NPC characterization contradicts canon

**Representative Korean quotes:**  
- "너무 쉽게 자백"  
- "자백을 했다 안했다, 본인이 잘못을 했다 안했다 말을 바꾸니까"  
- "자신이 범인이 아니라고 했었는데, 그 다음에 바로 자신이 범인이라고 말을 돌리는 부분"  

**Explanation:**  
Narrative inconsistency—such as NPCs contradicting themselves or changing established facts—quickly alerted players to artificiality, resulting in loss of trust in the game's world and severe drops in immersion.

## Pattern Theme 4: Artificial/AI-ness or Mechanical Cue → Disappointment/Confusion/Boredom → Immersion Decrease

**Rationale:**  
Unnatural pacing, mechanical or formulaic responses, or overtly "AI-like" phrasing caused players to recognize the NPC as non-human, evoking disappointment and breaking immersion.

**Representative descriptive_code values:**  
- AI-ness due to unnatural pace  
- Childish phrasing creates disconnect  
- Overly melodramatic feel  
- Generic/mechanical NPC response  
- NPC too AI-like, breaks immersion  

**Representative Korean quotes:**  
- "와 ai같다...싶은느낌이 들었다"  
- "짜여진 기계와 이야기하는 느낌"  
- "동화책같은 느낌이 들었다"  

**Explanation:**  
Pacing missteps (e.g., instant responses), mechanical or genre-incongruent phrasing, or lack of human nuance cued participants to the presence of AI, severing their suspension of disbelief and thus, immersion.

## Pattern Theme 5: Visual/Artistic/Design Cues → Joy/Interest/Awe → Immersion Enhancement

**Rationale:**  
Explicit mentions of visual design features (art, color, interface) that align with the narrative world fostered positive emotional responses and stronger immersion.

**Representative descriptive_code values:**  
- Visual design supports immersion  
- Well expressed fairytale world

**Representative Korean quotes:**  
- "게임 자체의 디자인, 색감, 그림체 등이 게임 세계에 더 몰입할 수 있도록 도와주었고"
- "동화 속 세계를 잘 표현해준 것 같다."

**Explanation:**  
Visual or artistic support for the story world provided participants with additional sensory cues, strengthening the believability of the setting and enhancing the overall immersive experience.

---

## Pattern Theme 6: Rationalization/Justification by Player → Curiosity/Mixed → Immersion Maintained or Restored

**Rationale:**  
Some participants rationalized incongruent or odd NPC behavior by referencing possible narrative justifications; this curiosity or reflective stance sometimes buffered or restored immersion.

**Representative descriptive_code values:**  
- Justified divergent behavior  
- Accepts possible character deception  
- Partial character consistency  
- Attributes positive evaluation to own ignorance

**Representative Korean quotes:**  
- "몰입이 방해되지는 않았다."  
- "거짓말을 잘 하는 사람일 수도 있고"  
- "초반의 캐릭터라면 일치성이 괜찮다고 생각한다."  

**Explanation:**  
Rather than dropping immersion, some participants employed their knowledge of the story, genre, or character psychology to make sense of apparent inconsistencies, mitigating their negative impact and occasionally turning them into points of interest.
