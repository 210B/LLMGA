## Theme 1: Character and Speech Consistency with Source Material

Many participants remarked on the strong alignment between character dialogue, personalities, and the original "Hamlet" source material. This consistency was credited with enhancing immersion, as characters spoke and acted in ways participants "expected" based on their knowledge of the narrative. Users repeatedly cited period-appropriate speech and recognizable character traits as key factors in sustaining engagement with the story world.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "원작과 비슷한 성격과 말투인 것 같다"  P09 B
- "알고 있는 햄릿 내용에서 이질감이 크게 들지 않았다."  P14 B
- "각 캐릭터들이 특징에 맞는 스타일의 답변을 했음."  P15 A

*Disconfirming evidence:* A minority noted that while speech styles matched, some character personalities (such as Claudius and Ophelia) deviated from expectations, which could break immersion for those more familiar with the original.

## Theme 2: Repetition and Over-Consistency in Dialogue

While consistency was generally valued, repetition of dialogue and overly predictable responses were frequently criticized. Some participants described feeling as if they were "talking to a wall," citing a lack of dynamic or responsive conversation. The perception of repetitive or formulaic answers, especially when all characters gave similar or affirming responses, reduced engagement and made the experience feel less human and interactive.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "다 똑같은 말투를 사용한거 같습니다"  P23 A
- "비슷한 답이 나오는 것을 보고 흥미가 떨어졌다."  P21 A
- "너무 일관되게 답변을 하는 것 같기도 했다."  P15 A

*Disconfirming evidence:* A few users expressed that high consistency actually aided the sense of realism, suggesting a nuanced threshold between consistency and monotony.

## Theme 3: Historical and Contextual Plausibility

Participants largely found the narrative, dialogue, and behavioral responses to be plausible within the historical and literary context of "Hamlet." This sense of plausibility, including old-fashioned language and adherence to the narrative setting, made it easier for users to immerse themselves in the story world. Even those less familiar with the original felt that the situations and conversations "belonged" to the period depicted.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "시대상, 정황상 했을 법한 말이라고 생각합니다."  P20 B
- "작품 배경에 어긋나는 말을 하지 않았음."  P18 B
- "오래전 있었던 사건들 속의 인물들과 대화하는 기분"  P01 B

*Disconfirming evidence:* A few participants questioned whether certain character knowledge or rapid confessions were believable within the source context, noting moments of contradiction or "melodrama."

## Theme 4: Perceptions of Artificiality and Breaks in Immersion

Despite overall positive reports of immersion, some users described moments when artificial dialogue delivery (e.g. speed, emotional flatness) or contradictory statements reminded them they were interacting with AI. Such moments included abrupt changes in character stance, mechanical or excessively cautious responses, and lack of logical progression in dialogue, which undermined the illusion of conversing with authentic characters.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "멘트가 너무 빨리나와서 와 ai같다"  P06 A
- "짜여진 기계와 이야기하는 느낌"  P08 A
- "클라디우스가 자신이 범인이 아니라고 했었는데, 그 다음에 바로 자신이 범인이라고 말을 돌리는 부분에서 어색함을 느꼈습니다."  P04 A

*Disconfirming evidence:* Some users explicitly stated they experienced no break in immersion or felt that small errors or fast delivery did not significantly disrupt their engagement.

## Theme 5: Visual and Design Elements Supporting Immersion

Although not a leading theme, several participants highlighted that visual design, color, and art style contributed positively to immersion, complementing the narrative experience. These environmental and aesthetic cues, alongside appropriate dialogue, helped deepen users' sense of being "inside" the story world.

**Exemplar quotes:**
- "디자인, 색감, 그림체 등이 게임 세계에 더 몰입할 수 있도록 도와주었고"  P04 A
- "동화 속 세계를 잘 표현해준 것 같다."  P05 A
- "고전적인 느낌을 주고 원작 세계관에 몰입할 수 있는 정도였다."  P15 A

*Disconfirming evidence:* The influence of visual design was not universally mentioned and was typically described as amplifying, rather than forming, the basis of narrative immersion.
