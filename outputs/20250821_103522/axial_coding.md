## 2) Propositions

1. If period_appropriate_speech is present, then high immersion_level and positive emotions (joy, awe, interest) are elicited, mediated by character-consistency and trait-evoking-speech.
2. If contradiction or off-character behavior occurs, then disappointment and low immersion_level result, mediated by confusion and perceived character-inconsistency.
3. If dialogue_repetition or over-consistency appears, then boredom and disengagement increase, mediated by monotonous-affirmation and surface-level communication.
4. If historical_plausibility in dialogue/behavior is maintained, then expected-responses and contextual believability increase, mediated by plausible-characterization.
5. If flat_response or mechanical delivery is perceived, then immersion_level drops, mediated by one-sided or lifeless dialogue.
