### 1) Relational Map: List of Edges

- historical_plausibility → supports → high immersion
- period_appropriate_speech → increases → high immersion
- flat_response/dialogue_repetition/contradiction → reduces → immersion_level (medium/low)
- expected/character-aligned speech → triggers → joy or interest
- contradiction/abstract dialogue/flat_response → causes → disappointment, confusion, or boredom
- repetitive/overly consistent replies → lessens → perceived realism
- authentic/role-consistent actions → foster → believability
- personality-expressive speech → enhances → narrative engagement
- contradictory actions/speech → lowers → engagement & plausibility

### 2) Propositions

1. **If** character dialogue and actions are historically plausible or period-appropriate, **then** immersion level rises, **mediated by** participant's joy, interest, or awe.
2. **If** responses are flat, repetitive, or contradictory, **then** immersion and engagement drop, **mediated by** boredom, disappointment, or confusion.
3. **If** NPC speech and behavior align with expected character roles, **then** perceived realism and believability improve, **mediated by** positive emotions and high immersion.
4. **If** speech is excessively consistent or formulaic, **then** realism is diminished, **mediated by** doubt, boredom, or detachment.
5. **If** NPC actions or motivations deviate from source expectation without plausible context, **then** engagement is disrupted, **mediated by** confusion or loss of narrative plausibility.

### 3) Korean Quotes (Distinctive Links)

1. **Consistency (historical plasibility → high immersion):**
   - “캐릭터들이 설정에서 벗어나는 말을 하지 않았다.” (`historical_plausibility` → high `immersion_level`)
2. **Contradiction (contradiction → low immersion/disappointment):**
   - “그 다음에 바로 자신이 범인이라고 말을 돌리는 부분에서 어색함을 느꼈습니다.” (`contradiction` → low `immersion_level`/`disappointment`)
3. **Flat/Non-interactive (flat_response → boredom):**
   - “캐릭터들의 대화가 벽이랑 대화하는 느낌이라서” (`flat_response` → `boredom`/low `immersion_level`)
