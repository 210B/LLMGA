# Pattern Codes: Trigger → Emotion → Immersion Shift

---

## 1. Consistent Character & Setting → Joy/Interest/Awe → Immersion ↑

**Rationale:**  
When NPCs' language, behavior, and motivations reliably fit the expected historical, narrative, or character framework, participants feel joy, interest, or awe. This supports and often heightens their immersion and engagement.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- Expected speech reinforces immersion  
- Character alignment with source increases immersion  
- Faithfulness to source supports immersion  
- Distinct personalities heighten immersion  
- Authentic responses reinforce immersion  
- Period language increases realism  
- Consistent, expected actions aid immersion  
- Contextual character responses support immersion  
- Believable motivation enhances narrative

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "예상했던 말투+멘트가 나와서"  
- "원작과 비슷한 성격과 말투인 것 같다"  
- "행동이 매우 일관되고 예상과 비슷하게 행동하였다."  
- "캐릭터가 작품 배경과 적합한 답변을 했기 때문에"

**Explanation:**  
Participants repeatedly report that when dialogue, tone, and behavior are loyal to the story’s world and source material—whether in speech style or emotional nuance—they find the characters more convincing and the scenario more engaging, drawing them deeper into the experience.

## 2. Contradiction/Repetition/Flatness → Boredom/Disappointment/Confusion → Immersion ↓

**Rationale:**  
Breaks in narrative logic—such as contradictory statements, repetitive replies, lack of interactivity, or recognizably 'AI-like' speech—trigger negative emotions (boredom, disappointment, confusion) and reduce immersion.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- NPC contradiction breaks immersion  
- Uniform speech reduces engagement  
- Flatness of dialogue harms immersion  
- AI-like responses harm immersion  
- Contradictory admissions cause frustration  
- Repetitive dialogue undermines engagement  
- Storybook tone harms engagement  
- Repetitive answers cause boredom  
- Abstract and repetitive dialogue

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "말을 바꾸는 부분에서 인공지능과 대화한다는 생각이... 흥미가 조금 떨어졌다"  
- "다 똑같은 말투를 사용한거 같습니다"  
- "벽보고 얘기하는 느낌이 강했다."  
- "같은 말만 계속해서 어색했다"

**Explanation:**  
Immersive breaks are most acute when NPCs shift opinions abruptly, repeat themselves, act robotic, or otherwise fail to respond interactively. These technical or design breakdowns directly lead to boredom, disappointment, or confusion, eroding the immersive game experience.

## 3. Plausible Nuance & Emotional Context → Interest/Curiosity/Joy → Immersion Stable or ↑

**Rationale:**  
Where NPCs exhibit subtlety, emotional depth, or clever context-appropriate behavior—not just expected stock answers—players report positive emotions like interest or curiosity, which can maintain or increase immersion.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- Subtle character traits spark engagement  
- Emotional expression supports engagement  
- Authentic personality perception  
- Contextual alignment with story phase  
- Emotional expression aligned with context  
- Plausible character actions  
- Balanced character reactions increase believability  
- Supporting dialogue matches characterization

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "내면의 악을 잘 숨겨서"  
- "공포나 두려움을 잘 표출했다고 생각함"  
- "정치적인 인물인것같다고 느꼈다."  
- "거짓말을 하며 흥분하는 모습이 매우 적절하게 표현되었다고 생각"

**Explanation:**  
Immersion is further strengthened when NPCs consistently display emotionally plausible or intricate traits—such as hiding their evil, feigning ignorance, or reacting subtly to the player's actions—because participants recognize and engage with these layered performances.

## 4. Visual/Design Atmosphere → Joy/Awe/Interest → Immersion ↑

**Rationale:**  
Compliments to visual, UI, and game design relate directly to feelings of joy, awe, and deepened immersion, even when not explicitly linked to dialogue or narrative consistency.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- Design enhances immersion  
- Visuals/world rendering supports immersion  
- Atmosphere enables narrative transportation

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "디자인, 색감, 그림체 등이 더 몰입할 수 있도록 도와주었고"  
- "동화 속 세계를 잘 표현해준 것 같다."  
- "타임머신을 타고 가서 대화하는 기분이 들었기 때문입니다."

**Explanation:**  
Atmospheric visuals and coherent UI are powerful immersion triggers in their own right, creating a compelling backdrop that seamlessly supports narrative engagement—even beyond dialogue.

## 5. Overt AI/Story Logic Error → Disappointment/Confusion → Immersion ↓

**Rationale:**  
When AI-ness becomes visible—through too-fast or mechanical responses, off-topic or logically impossible answers, or referencing its own artificiality—participants feel abrupt disappointment or confusion, sharply breaking immersion.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- Fast NPC response feels AI-like  
- Off-topic NPC answers cause confusion  
- NPC self-reference as AI breaks immersion  
- NPC out-of-character revelations

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "멘트가 너무 빨리나와서...와 ai같다...싶은느낌이 들었다"  
- "질문과 약간 관련없던 답을 들은 것 같음"  
- "클로디어스가 자신이 살인을 했다는 말을 함"

**Explanation:**  
Direct reminders that an interaction is with an AI—due to either pace, logic, or explicit self-reference—were highly disruptive to participant immersion, regardless of how "believable" the in-character facade was.

---

## 6. Overly Rigid Consistency → Mixed/Curiosity → Immersion Stable or ↓

**Rationale:**  
While consistency is generally positive, some users find overly rigid behavioral or verbal patterns (e.g., NPCs always giving the same answers) to diminish realism, sparking mixed feelings or curiosity rather than outright negative responses.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- Overly consistent replies noticed  
- Over-consistency triggers doubt  
- Consistently vague answers cause boredom  
- Overly cautious, repetitive dialogue

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "너무 일관되게 답변을 하는 것 같기도 했다."  
- "너무 대답에 일관성이 있으면 오히려 의문이 들 수도 있을 것 같다."  
- "지나치게 조심스럽고 반복되는 말만 하는 느낌이 들었다."

**Explanation:**  
Sustained consistency without variation can cross into predictability or monotony, leading participants to question authenticity or feel less engaged—even though outright contradictions are deemed worse.

---

## 7. Scenario/Dialogue Prompts Curiosity → Curiosity/Interest → Immersion ↑

**Rationale:**  
Questions about what might happen next or curiosity inspired by scenario decisions (rather than errors) foster engagement and a desire to re-engage, thereby boosting immersion.

**Representative Descriptive Codes:**  
- Dialogue prompts curiosity to explore  
- Desire for extended dialogue  
- Curiosity about future story  
- Scenario prompts reflective curiosity

**Korean Quotes:**  
- "여러캐릭터와 대화를 더 해보고 싶은 느낌이 들었기 때문에"  
- "오히려 다음 이야기가 궁금합니다"  
- "다음 행동이 조금 고민되었다."

**Explanation:**  
When the narrative or NPCs raise genuine questions or hooks, or if dialogue is engaging enough to prompt further exploration, participants report curiosity, which positively sustains or increases immersion.
