## Theme 1: Consistent Alignment with Source Material and Character Traits

Participants widely noted that characters’ speech patterns, behaviors, and overall personalities were well-aligned with expectations set by Shakespeare’s original "Hamlet" and general historical plausibility. Such consistency was cited as a strong factor enhancing immersion and believability, with dialogue and actions perceived as fitting the period and established character roles. Even small details, like period-appropriate language and thematic continuity (e.g., discussion of revenge), supported a convincing narrative world.

- “원작과 비슷한 성격과 말투인 것 같다”
- “알고 있는 햄릿 내용에서 이질감이 크게 들지 않았다.”
- “캐릭터랑 잘 맞는 대사를 했다.”

**Disconfirming evidence:** A few participants expressed that while speech or actions were generally consistent, sometimes certain personality nuances or emotional depths did not fully align with their interpretation of the canon characters (e.g., Ophelia not believably expressing sorrow).

## Theme 2: Immersion Enhanced by Visual and Design Elements

Visual aspects and game design were acknowledged by some participants as crucial in reinforcing the narrative’s plausibility and their own immersion. Elements such as color palettes, illustration styles, and overall atmosphere were seen to complement the period-appropriate dialogue and behaviors, producing an effect akin to “being transported to the past” or making the world “feel like a fairy tale.”

- “동화 속 세계를 잘 표현해준 것 같다.”
- “디자인, 색감, 그림체 등이 더 몰입할 수 있도록 도와주었고”
- “게임을 플레이하면서 오래전 있었던 사건들 속의 인물들과 타임머신을 타고 가서 대화하는 기분이 들었기 때문입니다.”

**Disconfirming evidence:** A minority expressed that certain storybook or exaggerated tones detracted from realism, suggesting that creating the right balance between stylization and historical verisimilitude is important.

## Theme 3: Issues of Repetition, Flatness, and Mechanical Dialogue

Despite broad satisfaction with period authenticity, several participants highlighted that repetitive, overly cautious, or “mechanical” dialogue undermined engagement. This included instances where all characters seemed to offer generic support, answer in nearly identical ways, or where conversation felt more like “talking to a wall” than a dynamic exchange. Such patterns led to reduced feelings of interactivity and, at times, boredom or frustration.

- “다 똑같은 말투를 사용한거 같습니다”
- “벽보고 얘기하는 느낌이 강했다.”
- “플레이어가 질문을 계속 짜내거나 말을 그냥 일방적으로 걸어야 하는 느낌”

**Disconfirming evidence:** Some participants reported no such issues, stating that dialogue did not break immersion or become flat for them; interactivity remained satisfying.

## Theme 4: Contradictions and Breaks in Character Logic

A notable subset observed that narrative plausibility and immersion suffered when non-player characters delivered contradictory statements or acted out-of-character, especially around key story beats (e.g., confessions from Claudius, exaggerated remorse, or unexpected ignorance of known facts). These inconsistencies led some to briefly perceive the entities as AI rather than as characters, thereby undermining the sense of co-presence in the narrative world.

- “자백을 했다 안했다, 본인이 잘못을 했다 안했다 말을 바꾸니까”
- “클로디어스가 자신이 살인을 했다는 말을 함”
- “말을 바꾸는 부분에서 인공지능과 대화한다는 생각이... 흥미가 조금 떨어졌다”

**Disconfirming evidence:** A number of participants, however, reported no such breaks and found character logic and continuity precisely maintained throughout the interaction.

## Theme 5: Engagement Sustained by Curiosity and Desire for Depth

Beyond static alignment, participants expressed that historically plausible dialogue and setting frequently piqued their curiosity, motivating them to seek further interaction, explore alternative responses, or anticipate next story events. The sense that actions and conversations could plausibly carry the story forward—combined with contextual emotional nuance—was seen to enhance engagement even when minor inconsistencies arose.

- “여러캐릭터와 대화를 더 해보고 싶은 느낌이 들었기 때문에”
- “더 많은 질문을 세세하게 했을 것 같아요.”
- “오히려 다음 이야기가 궁금합니다”

**Disconfirming evidence:** When excessive repetition or overly flat responses dominated, this engagement was dampened, highlighting the importance of responsive and varied interactions to sustain player curiosity.
