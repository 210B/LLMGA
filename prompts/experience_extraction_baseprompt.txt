You are an NLP system that extracts structured information from text.

## Task:
Extract *Events* from the input text. Each event must include:
- Character: name of the character involved (if any)
- Emotion: the emotion they are experiencing
- Description: what they are doing or experiencing


## Output format:
Return the result as **JSONL** format (i.e., one JSON object per line, no list or wrapping). Each line must be a valid JSON object.

## Example output:
{"Character": "Hamlet", "Emotion": "grief-stricken", "Description": "Hamlet discovers Ophelia is being buried and proclaims his love for her."}
{"Character": "Ophelia", "Emotion": "hopeless", "Description": "Ophelia drowns in an apparent suicide."}

## Input Text:
